00:00:05
Welcome, welcome, welcome, and welcome again to any crypto, welcome retail fam! Welcome to this live stream from the desert. It's just what it is, so uh, by the way, I cannot see, so I'm not at my desk, so it's gonna be a little bit of uh managing around over here today. But you know, I just had to do this live stream today, so I hope that everything is running fine, uh, so uh. Today, I got someone else doing today a little bit of producing work and uh, well, maybe she wants to say something. Hi guys, you already know me, so he says we will; I will help Mw (I'm also traveling), I'm in the jungle, so let's hope everything works out fine today. Have fun with the stream and well let the music play, don't we? Thank you,

00:03:10
thank you, thank you, thank you. Let's dive in, let's dive in. The music can't stop. Thank you guys, welcome, welcome. Little film, what do I got? What do I gotta wait? What I got? What do I got? Let me go for all content that's the first one, Sean we got Marco Lat uh, what do you got this is Bob we got the zoo park travel 11. welcome my brother sean pedro helena i miss you guys salma rashid bobby karima z's rex alpima nicholas uh

00:03:45
closing into resistance guys by the way today I'm gonna show you something I'm gonna you know we're gonna do a market update check some altcoins see what we're you know you know how are we feeling you know how we're feeling you know if you ask Alpiman how he's feeling he'll tell you I don't know he never knows how he's feeling but I'm gonna show you guys a little bit of educational thing I'm gonna do into the market a very important thing and by the way this is I'm going to explain to you guys a little bit about Alpiman. Alpiman is exactly the guy how to not do it. So that's why I take Alpiman as an example. Because Alpiman is the average retailer in crypto, in trading, whatever.

00:04:28
So Alpiman is the average retailer. So 99% of people trading are like Alpiman. So I'm going to explain to you why you should never ever be Alpiman. Just whatever it is you do in your life, don't be Alpiman. Don't do it like Alpiman. Because if you do it like Alpiman, you know, it was very funny. I saw the guy, it was about, what's the trade? I think it was Leia. Leia went to almost 160, and then Leia came down into 138 or whatever it was, and then he thought, oh, wait a minute, it went below the Indy, so let me short it now. And then, into the short and the price went up and then he went down in a small loss, oh I did it again, oh I ruined the trade again, and then you know I'm not gonna touch it anymore, you know that's the problem with Alpiman.

00:05:21
Alpiman is the average retailer training, so I'm gonna expect yeah I'm gonna explain you guys today exactly how to do, don't do don't do it like Alpiman, whatever it is you're doing, don't do it with Alpiman. Alpiman is scared, you know. He needs like 10 whiskeys to make a trade, you know. So, you know, he needs to tell himself, okay, Alpiman, okay, you're strong enough. Okay, you're man enough. Okay, you just got to push that freaking button. You don't gotta be afraid. Yes, just go. That's Alpiman. That's how to not do it. So, I'm going to explain to you guys. So, Alpiman, thank you for that. Thank you for that. You gave me a little bit of inspiration. You know, it was. A little bit of inspiration. So we got Fedcox.

00:06:05
We got Ziggy. We got Ellen. We got the Roy McCoy Top Doc. Si Bueno. Mr. John El Floriano. Lazy Bear. Oh, John Doe Cheesecake. We got Rosie AFR Mark S. We got Danny Diggs. For Jerry, the Roy McCoy. And though it's too long, three whole days was time to get rid of. Don't get withdrawal symptoms, bro. We trademark this up and down. We don't give a fuck. It's just dead. It's just dead. So we got Biggie. By the way, guys, yesterday was a celebration of the Eid for a lot of Muslims, but also today. So it was like the half of the Muslims in the world, they saw the moon somewhere and then you

00:07:00

Guys, keep an eye on this Michael Vorba. I don't know why, but I think that this Michael Vorba is one of those guys with potential. I just feel it. This guy, he likes racing, and I think that he likes trading.

00:07:41
These people that are successful in sports, what does that say about those people? First of all, they've got talent, but all those people that do sports, they are very dedicated. They're very strong. They don't give up. They work very hard and you know when they, you know, you have to see it like this because you know I've been playing sports at a very high level uh many many decades ago and you know um I also played for a national team by the way I'm not going to tell you what sport or whatever but you know I know that feeling when you want to be the best in something when you know, I just know how that feels like. So, you know, I think that Michael Vorba has got that.

00:08:21
So, what do we got? Oh, we got the frogman. We got Leon. The Mannschaft. Mannschaft, Deutschland, Germany. We got Gap. We got Pip. We got Stacey. We got Adria. We got Salsa. Let's go. Goedemiddag. Goedemiddag vanuit de woestijn. Okay, let's see. Let's see. Okay, guys. Let's start him. By the way, guys. Forgive me for the screen because I'm doing this live stream on a laptop. i'm not on my desk and that's also why i asked salsara to help me you know manage manage manage the the the you know the producing and you know whatever it is the music etc etc so i can focus on this one so forgive me about the screen screen

00:09:02
is a little bit okay so first of all guys thank you for all the dms and thank you for all the traits that we have been nailing again again and again and i understand that for some people it's a surprise that we nailed them for me it's no surprise and for a lot of people that have been with me for a very long time it's also a surprise so that's one number two for the ones that are you know interested in gtc in the team guys be very careful there are a lot of gtc fake accounts scam accounts out there it's a lot so if you are interested because they're opening some spots for their april they're going into april Again, a lot of some people uneducated retailers that they have been asking and advising to leave the group or at least pause the group until they get a little bit more matured in trading, then come back.

00:09:48
There are also a lot of people that are more willing to join them. But let me tell you this guy's before you're going to join them, you know be sure that you already be you're educated by me; you saw my leverage trading course, oh by the way if you join them, you will get the leverage trading course so they will give it to you. But let me just say this guy's, if you join those guys don't expect those... I don't know maybe you were In some doctor profit group or in some I don't know what to expect some signal group whatever these guys are professional traders and when they share a trade they

00:10:19
go on it, you know these guys are very serious most serious people I know and they don't lose and they don't want to lose so when they take trades they chase trade a lot they choose their targets and they don't make like you know 20 30 40 trades in a week they take maybe like four at least the ones that they share. They make a lot of trades, but the ones that they share that they feel comfortable on while they're protecting your portfolio at the same time, they share maybe like two, three, four, five, six, seven trades. It depends on how the markets are. And that's it. but you know when they do they

00:10:50
do it good that's just you know that's just their stuff that's what they do so the only account that these guys have they have only one account that's that's gtc team traders i think if i remember it good so that's the only account that they own so and by the way guys be patient they will respond to all of you on time so Tomorrow is the new month, I think. So they will respond to everyone. So that's about that. About me, guys, for the ones that are in the Patreon, it's very simple, guys. Don't think that Telegram and Patreon is exactly the same. The only thing that we are saying is on Telegram, you can pay with crypto, no taxes.

00:11:27
countries they are paying 30 40 taxes sometimes patreon is easily increasing the monthly fees the fees are only 49 bucks and uh you know i don't know what patreon is doing i don't know you know for me it's very simple on the pin post you'll find my telegram and it's very simple over there you can do whatever it is so if you are already in patreon it's no problem just remain there stay there when your subscription ends you can flip the telegram it's that simple very simple not a lot of so that's about that also there's coming a lot of news i already shared some of it uh on twitter so you know there's

00:12:03
a lot of working very hard behind the scenes and uh just wait for me to announce to make announcements so just wait for me there's a lot going to happen so let me get into the trades before we go into the crypto trades we're going into uh our our trades that are running in the altcoins we're going to talk about the mark so mark is very simple guys it's mind-blowing look at wall street look so over here we went up I know, I know. By the way, guys, for the ones that are DMing me, thank you so much. Yes, I know. MW, you keep nailing. It's mind-blowing. The only thing, the only thing that you have to do is, you know, if you don't lie, don't be dishonest, just be honest.

00:12:43
The only thing that I ask retailers to do is this. Because I was talking with Salsara today about this. You know, you have to fight. We have to fight. I'm fighting. So while I'm fighting for you guys because that's what I'm doing. I'm fighting for you guys. So you guys will not get wrecked What I'm asking from you is this I'm asking for you. Just one don't go do it ten times a day Because that's when they will ghost you and they will, you know. Don't do that. Just just one time in a day, for example M will kill a predicted this or M will killer made me this trade or Elm Killer is

00:13:23
nailing the pnls or ML Killer is this or whatever it is I don't care what it is just be honest or maybe ML Killer is a big f**k or ML I hate the guy ML Killer sucks I don't give a f**k what you want to do just be honest for me it's just be honest, be honest. Just don't lie. Just be honest. What I'm wanting is that you guys make this as a comment on all the big accounts in crypto and why am I saying this because normally you know There will be soon there will be someone that will give you some more instructions about this, you know I don't work with crypto content creators. I don't work with altcoins to be shield.

00:14:00
I don't work with the marketing machine, I don't work with all these scary people. The only people that I got is you; you are my people. I fight for you. And I expect just a little bit something back from you. The only thing that you have to do is, you know, suppose that some big crypto account, they just posted something. They know that a lot of retailers will go into that post. Just put a comment out there and we'll just tell the truth. Don't lie. Just tell the truth. Just one time or two times a day. It's enough. But if my retail firm will do this, like, you know, like two, three, four, five hundred people every day in all those accounts, whatever you want to choose. That's how you help me.

00:14:39
That's how we grow. That's how we will destroy the marketing machine. You guys have no clue how strong you are together. If the retail family, just together, just do this once. It's five seconds work. Five seconds. You're scrolling through your feed and then you see some recent posts from some big account. And then you put in just, you know, my tag and will kill it. That's it. Just once, a time nobody, nobody will harass you about it, nobody will feel bad about it, nothing. You just do that one time or you do it two times in two accounts every day while you're scrolling and we'll kill this and just tell the truth again. I'm not asking you to lie for me, I'm not asking you to show me just say the freaking truth, just say okay and we're gonna call your stop and we'll go cold the Bitcoin top, I'm all cold this short and we'll call cold that's all code.

00:15:32
I'm gonna call this one, just say the truth, I'm not asking you to lie, just say the truth, okay. So that's what I'm asking from you guys, that's what I'm asking for you guys, so basically, so we had this, you know, we had this down and I told you know, I told you that this was gonna happen, guys, I told you that this was gonna happen, I told you, we had this one. Oh, go away, um, where is it? Why is this thing going up? I want you over here, um, this one, so we had we had we had this dump down, and I told you we're going to have this bounce and this

00:16:06
bounce, I told you also exactly over here, that's what uh, I know it's sick, guys, now it's sick, it's going down, and now we are making that double that I told you about, also a couple of days ago, you know everything that is happening now, I also already told you about it, I told you about it over here, told you about this, you know everything that is happening now, I already told you about this, so you know. Actually, I took you into the future, and why is it so important? Because if you trade it just based on this, you would have made sick money because over here where I was shouting like you have to buy the blood guys buy the blood heroes are telling you buy fart coin buy SPX buy Giga whatever you know all those Cody etc.

00:16:54
over here we're buying them Over here was already yelling, take profits, guys. Take profits, guys. Take profits, guys. Please, don't be greedy. Just take profits. Over here is where we took profits. Over here was also when I told you, okay, prepare to open up the short, short, short. Because over here was telling you, focus on the longs. Focus on long. Focus on long. Over here they were telling you, focus on shorts. Focus on shorts. Focus on shorts. This is how you make money up and down. That's it, and you know it was very funny because I've been watching some of my feed and I saw some accounts out there pretending as if they understand macro. You know, oh Trump, you know Trump is Trump is Trump is killing the markets and Trump is making trouble.

00:17:39
And you know the SPX is looking what the are you talking about? You don't know, you don't understand, you know, you've been shilling people to go all in for months. And now out of the sudden, oh, the markets are going down. You should be very careful. I think that we might go down. I'm going to tell you everything about it today. Yes, yes. Bro, you already destroyed all these people because you told them go all in, go all in, go all in at the top. When MW was short, ETFs were getting announced. When MW started telling people, okay, get out of the markets. You guys were all telling them, go all in. We have no money. This is your lot. There will be no other dip.

00:18:25
And then now out of the sudden, yeah, well, you know what? Well, the markets are dumping. And, you know, not exactly when we are at the double bottom. Yeah, well, you know, maybe the markets are down and Trump is horrible. You know what they want? They want you to sell your bags in big losses. because they were fucking you they were fucking they fuck you over here telling you to go all in and they fuck you over here to tell you well the markets are not looking that good so what does that mean the market's not looking that good it means they want you to sell your bags wrecked so when the bounce happens then oh fuck these fuckers are fucking me again and again and again they keep fucking me these fuckers what you do you gotta buy in again

00:19:11
on a balance of 10 20 30 you gotta buy in again and the way you buy it again oh it's gonna hit the indicator and then it dumps down again yeah well yeah well guys this is the game this is how the game works this is just how it works in city how much more do i need to show you guys to believe me this is what they do they create you the sentiment don't listen to these These fuckers, this is exactly what they do. These guys are horrible. These guys are monsters. These guys have no souls. These guys will suck you in and they spit you out and they stamp on your fucking face. That's what they do. Okay, back. Listen, guys. So this is the double.

00:19:58
And we even made, so let me move this a little bit over here. This over here, guys. We made another low. So we made another low. I told you we need to test this red zone. So Wall Street is pretty strong. So we're not testing this red zone for now. So it's bouncing up. But listen, guys, this would be at some point, this should be super bullish because this is the double that I've been talking about. This double, see? This double could pump markets up. let me tell you what is disturbing me a little bit on this one i'm gonna show you i'm gonna show you i'm gonna take you step by step that's what i do look at this one come on internet look at this one this thing is still at super low or not super low but it's still at low level so this thing we were over here this was the low up

00:20:56
down so now we're struggling to get above the indicator so let me just tell you this if this thing we are here at pretty big support so if this thing if the dollar would come down to the 99 cents levels then i would say okay okay well maybe that double is going to work out in the us 500 will pump the markets up with with crypto included i would believe it at that point but then i'm going to look at another chart and i'm going to look at this one this internet sucks so over here this one this is the this is the euro against the dollar this one you see it's it's it's it's the indicators let me remove all this remove so this one it's holding the indicator over here let me put it on the wiki so you can see it better better better so this thing i told you already i i'm very embarrassed

00:21:56
on on the euro i'm super bearish on the euro by the way not only embarrassing super bearish on the euro super super bearish on the euro so the euro over here we didn't test this zone yet we came over here but i think that we gotta touch this one i think that we gotta touch it and if we're gonna touch this one it means that this one it means that this one will probably go test at least the indicator at the 106 levels and if this one goes to the 106 levels it means that this one most probably Doesn't have to be like that, oh my god, look at this, so um this thing will probably come or probably make another dump down, so that's what I'm expecting, now that's what I'm playing on, so for me now at this moment, this, this, this bounce that is making so this double is super bullish,

00:22:47
I told you again and again and again, it's you know in in trading uh how you, how you can recognize that, you know the big boys against the small whatever boys out there boys just boys you know making a pattern, everyone can do this, predicting it is another, you know you have to dig in deep to know, okay, is this double gonna play out, yes or no and for now I'm not. Seeing it so, yes we could bounce up here very strongly, no problem. You can use the even on the four hour to get a little bit more confirmation, you know, you know, you know, you know all people, yes, confirmation over here, so oh it's pretty far away by the way it's oh it's testing in one hour as we speak it's testing the one hour so let's see, let's see how it's gonna play out, you know I'm, you know I'm, you know I'm, told you this is a double so over here you should, you should have bought some blood crypto

00:23:47
just like I explained, this was the well so you should have bought at least a little bit of blood for the bounce up, so you should have bought something. Up so it should be in a little bit of green now, but um, yeah. And take profits on the way up, so I don't think that a lot more is going to happen, so that's about that. Let me go to a bit of coin; a bit the coin is just uh reacting over here on the markets, that's what it's doing that's oh, it does in the way, guys, uh, in the last room, uh, after that expiry I already told you that, you know, if Bitcoin will not push to the 88 or the $93, if we pushed over here to the alien, but if we're not going to push into this red zone after the expiry, you know, I think that things are much worse.

00:24:29
So let me just say this: uh, I'm Very very very very very bearish on bitcoin and I think that bitcoin will make uh will make its dump so let me see where are we now let me let me uh we do have another chart, I have another chart, this one you have another one, no, I don't, this dominance you've got another Bitcoin chart with some, no, I don't, why I don't have that, I had I made a nice chart for Bitcoin, I made several ones, why is it not showing now? So yeah, for me, it's you know, it's very clear, you know, it's just a matter of time. We'll hit this zone. I will the $70,000, you know, and the $70,000 is just a matter of time in my opinion.

00:25:19
So even if this thing will just travel over here, whatever 85 86, you know, we traveled when we dumped out over here from there. I called this topic to perfection, you know. I need to find that video when I call the 103 and I call the 109 because I called this before it happened; i call this into perfection because I remember that I called the top uh the previous cycle at $69,000 or $70,000 into perfection and I also called this top, I think it was over here somewhere. I call this stop into perfection, this top 109. i made a vid exactly i told you this and bitcoin might dump to 109 and that will be the end of it so it's now now and you know you know

00:26:04
we have this you know you know we have this weekly candle over here this is a nasty candle by the way and this was also into that close it's really ridiculous that you know there just were no bulls left no no bulls no bulls so into the expiry this was very you know that was a sign to me okay this is these these these these these motherfuckers they really want to dump it down so for now it's just the marks holding it down so for me it's just a matter of time we're gonna hold we're gonna hit this i think we're gonna hit this so it might chop around over chop around and then you know we might hit this create a little bit be by the way guys be very very careful i'm gonna buy in in the red zone over here i'm gonna I'm gonna buy in, I'm gonna buy in, I'm gonna buy it, I'm gonna repeat myself, I'm gonna buy.

00:26:51
You gotta buy, you gotta buy it. I'm gonna update you guys what I'm gonna buy exactly just like uh past time but uh I'm gonna buy so for now this is you know what we're seeing now this jumping around this is just for us trading this we gotta trade the crap out of a lot of altcoins just what we have been doing on Bearer like we have doing on Layer like we have done on What Is It Teams it was on Party it was on Whatever, just make money, make money, it's just free, it's out there, just just make the money, just just enjoy yourself, just. You know the there was one guy who told me this and I'm gonna buy myself a car, what kind of car? A Mercedes, well, whatever, okay.

00:27:27
Well, congrats, yeah! It's a car for uh, what was it 47k or something? Oh, congrats! I'm glad for yeah, you know I made it. Wow, shorting outcomes, what yes? Shorting outcomes, you teach me, well, you showed me what. Thank you, Mr. I'm working, I'm gonna buy Mercedes. I'm from Russia, I'm from Russia, I'm gonna buy Mercedes. Why? Because I'm from Russia and I like German cars. I don't like German people, but I do like German cars. Oh, so you're going to buy Mercedes? Yes, I'm going to buy Mercedes. And I made it by shorting shitty coins. I never did it before, but you showed me the way. And now I'm making money. So I want to tell you thank you, Mr. World Killer. I really want to thank you.

00:28:06
Can I send you a little bottle of vodka? With the best vodka. A vodka is very nice in Russia. I want to send you a nice button, Mr. Welcome, because you made me a lot of money. These Russians, I love them; I just love these Russians for the reason so... um, so yeah, it's now a little chatting around and uh, for all the money, okay? So that's about that. So let me go to the altar; let me go to the altar, let me go to the altar, coins, I'll take coins, and let me like this. I need to see what's freaking so... We got better! First of all, Oh, what a beauty, what a beauty! Oh, Berra, Berra, Berra, Berra. Berra, Berra, Berra!

00:28:53
How much money did you guys make in the live stream in the chat? How much money did you make from this? A lot of money, aren't you? You made a lot of money on this, didn’t you? Didn’t you? Didn’t you? You shouldn’t mess with them. And you did. So now you’re feeling the pain. It’s just what it is. So congrats, everyone, for Barra. So Barra, Barra, Barra! And then we got this Lay 3. What is it? It’s a Lay 3. Look at this. Lay 3. Oh! Oh! Yeah, all three. Oh! Okay, there you go. Now you got this Tutu. Tutu! Tutorial. Hmm. Is the tutorial still looking juicy? Gotta do some more research on this one; I will let you know, I will let you know, I will let you know.

00:29:46
Then what do we got? What do we got? What do we got? Okay, we got this layer of a layer, layer has been fighting so strong, look at this chart, guys, look at this chart! I'm gonna remove all of this, so layer has been, you know, layer have, layer has been, uh, you know, showing a lot of power. You cannot, you know, these Koreans know better by now, you know. You cannot fight a war killer. Do you really think that this scandal is going to change Rita Film's mind? Mr. Korea, I don't know how to do the Korean accent, by the way. I really have no clue how to do the Korean accent. But, you know, Mr. Korea, you have to understand that it doesn't matter how you want to manipulate the charge.

00:30:30
It doesn't matter how strong you want to do it. It doesn't matter with how many of you guys will do it. I trained my retail fam to protect themselves from you. So you do you. But you have to always know that at the end of the road, we will share the peanuts and we are going to make money. So next time when you see me posting something, just let it go. Don't even try it. Just let it go, so congrats for everyone! What do we hit? We hit the one, three, one, I think that this thing will very, very, very soon come to the you know, one oh and uh, uh what are you, what are you?

00:31:17
I think that I think that it's just Bitcoin, are holding bouncing a little bit, I think that this thing will, you know, very soon, very soon we'll go. Test this service again, you know! Because, you know, we had it. You have to see it like this. Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres. And, you know, this is where you take profits. So don't go, don't go, oh, no, I'm working. I'm going for the home run. That's not what we do. That's what they want you to do. They want you to do that so they wreck you. That's not what we do. What we do is we are traders. We make money. We close that money and we go hunt again. We're going to look for the weak ones.

00:31:59
We're going to look for the best opportunities that will give us the massive gains. That's what we do. That's our style. We're not going to make this personal. We're not going to make this personal because when you're going to make things personal, that's when the emotions get in. And that's not what we do. We don't let emotions get to us. What we do is, yes, exactly, that's what we do. We are traders. We are no gamblers. So we trade. We fight. And when the rewards come, we take them. Why do we take them? Because we close them in. And then we're going to reserve a little part. And with that other part, we got to make. We got to go into the next fight. And the next fight. And the next fight.

00:32:40
And the next fight. And the next fight. And at some point, it will be no fights anymore. Because you will be the MWs. And the MWs, they just, you know, whatever. Oh, well, you went, oh, let's short it. Let's long it. And then you just go to sleep and, you know, or you sleep two days or three days and suddenly you open up. Oh, oh, I was right again. Yes, you were right again. Why were you right again? Because you're doing it the professional way. Because you're no fucking amateur. Because the crypto game is made for amateurs. There are no professional traders in crypto. You know why? They eliminate them. They ghost them. They make sure that they will not appear.

Okay. So, let me see. What do we got? Chimps. Boom, boom. James, thank you. Fartcoin. Oh, Fartcoin. Fartcoin, by the way, guys. Fartcoin is by far the most popular coin in the retail fare. And, you know, there was one guy who told me, listen, MW, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Fartcoin, don't you make that massive, that massive, massive, massive, massive P&R that you showed us. How did you do that? I want that also, it made almost a 3X. How did you do that? You know how they did that? Let me tell you. You have to listen. Fucking listen. Because, you know, when it was dumping and I told you, listen, this is the coins. You have to be focusing on meme coins. Focus on fucking meme coins.

00:35:08
Don't listen to those that were getting you into, you know. This is what makes me mad. You know, maybe I'm repeating myself too much, but, you know, I have to fucking say this. They were telling you to buy meme coins. They were telling you to buy meme coins in these levels over here and over here and over here. This is where they kill you. Buy meme coins. This is where the marketing machine will destroy you. And why am I repeating myself? It's going to happen again. It's going to happen again and again and again and again and again. It's just what they do. When the temporary top will come in, that's when the promotion will be.

00:35:49
Making its made most hours so this is by the way when we start shorting the crap out of all the sponsors that’s what we do okay so like we did like we did our fart coin so but you know and this is what hurts me most is over here when we’re bottoming out and we’re having these bottom formations over here then you get this the same people that were telling you to buy away or to you know what maybe it’s like that we’re gonna flip yeah you know why yeah Maybe it’s time that, you know, these meme coins are worth nothing. Yeah. You know, I released three meme coins myself and I wrecked all of you guys.

00:36:25
But, you know, you know, I made millions on these meme coins while I wrecked you all. But, you know, you guys are stupid enough to keep following me and keep watching my show. So, you know what? I’m telling you now. just go look for some solid altcoins, you know, some solid, strong, fundamentally altcoins. Yes, okay, that’s what we got to do. Okay, you know what? Fuck it. I'm going to sell my Fartcoin because I'm in like 80% line of loss. And, you know, you're the same person that told me to buy meme coins and rocked me like over and over and over again and cycle after cycle. So you keep fucking me every freaking time. You told me that I need to focus on solid. Okay, well, fuck it.

00:37:00
I'm going to buy some Polkadot. I'm going to buy some Atom. I'm going to buy some Sui. I'm going to buy some Say. I'm going to sell this fucking Fartcoin. And then Fartcoin makes a 3x. Oh, oh goes up with 300. Oh, what did I do? What did I do? Yes, The M Will Killer, he was telling me at the top that he was gonna short it. He, it, he killed it; he killed it. And then you know, M will killer. You know the meme con killer of 2024. Because that's how they call me, I mean, and they're right because nobody has been making millions on shorting meme coins, apologies that are like me, and sharing it openly.

00:37:39
By the way, nobody, nobody well, my will killer the biggest meme coin killer is telling you to buy SPX Giga, a fat coin, well they're all telling you just stay away from it; they pump the hardest on the bounce. So I want you guys to listen to me because why? Because it's gonna happen again and again so we're gonna be there so I'm gonna update you very soon I'm gonna make a meme coin uh what I think the meme was double that will uh pump the most uh and let me see uh here also this guy look at this look at this look at this Mr. CZ, Mr. CZ, here, Mr. CZ look at this boom, boom, boom they're just sucking in and then this is no surprise Go watch my BNB, my Biden's BNB coins.

00:38:30
Look at this. Just look at this. Now you got this plume. Look at plume. Look at plume. Look at plume. Come on, plume. Look at plume. Look. See this? See this? Those lines are not there for nothing. And by the way, guys, the strongest coin, this is, by the way, the strongest coin, guys. This still is. It still is the strongest coin. Strongest coin in crypto in my opinion and look at this guys, look at this, you know we have been chasing this, we have been destroying this, this fucking coin, this OM but listen guys, it's still holding, we dumped it, dumped down over here, but this is still holding the line over here, it's holding this line over here.

00:39:10
Okay, so also I know that you guys probably forgot about this, I also tweeted something about an ecosystem that I want to buy. So, this ecosystem, I'm not going to buy the altcoins related to it. I'm interested in two coins. I'm interested in the ecosystem itself, the coin, the native coin of this ecosystem itself. And I'm going to look for the meme coin, the biggest meme coin of this ecosystem. And I'm not going to announce it today. I'm going to make a special live stream for that one because I want to use the timing right because I want to time it. So when I do it, maybe I'm even going to do this live stream and buy it live.

00:39:49
i'm gonna talk i'm gonna start buying dca live here i'm still not gonna buy it i think it's just too high for me now but i'm gonna share it with you very soon soon soon soon soon um uh let me let me see let me see what we're gonna do okay guys so that's basically it what i was gonna talk about for me let me go back to uh let me go back to uh to bitcoin uh what i'm expecting i think that bitcoin bitcoin is really pathetic guys it's super bearish so my my thesis my bs stays the same if it changes i will tell you change but it didn't change for now

00:40:24
so now it's just the bounce from this freak so we're gonna get this bounce it will be chopping around maybe come back together but you know it in my opinion the us 500 needs to test this this red zone and we didn't yet so let me remove this one although this is super bullish this double but you know i just you know you know at some point you know my my my my my my gut feeling i need to i need to tell you and by the way i didn't do the educational part by the way i'm gonna save that for the next one because i think that uh all people has been getting beaten up enough by me today.

00:40:59
And I think that his wife is also very angry at me for beating him up every time again and again and again. Because she's envying me. She's telling me, listen, MW, just go fuck yourself. I'm the only one that is in right to beat the fuck out of Oppiemann. And while you're beating the fuck out of him, at some point, you're not leaving anything to me. Let me fuck him up for you. You just shut the fuck up. Let me do it for you. Just joking, Oppiemann. no listen so um uh guys i'm gonna i'm gonna close it up so for now let's just watch how strong this bounce is uh by the way the shorts are running uh I think that profits have been taken.

00:41:40
But, you know, as long as we're below this Indy, the shorts will only get added and added and added and added and taken profits and added that resistance. So just trade the Indy. Just like I educate you guys. Just trade the Indy. It's that simple. It's, you know, it's that simple. It's that simple. Okay, guys. Thank you so much. I love you all for joining in.
