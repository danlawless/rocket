00:00:57
It's really mind-blowing how someone calls the top over here and calls the bottom over here and tells the temporary bottom at least, but then calls you okay this is now the time, you know you cannot imagine how many people have been calling me have been contacting me and I'm talking about really wealthy people in the world. They've been calling me around 48 million. Should we start buying? Should we start loaning? They're like, yes, yes. I told you over here that you should do it. I told you over here that you should loan over here. So it's not, don't listen to me now. Over here, this was weeks ago. I told you, okay, over here, you can short or just get out. And over here, you have to buy in.

00:01:42
It's just that simple. And then. You know, they get scared. And these are guys, you have to see it like this. These wealthy people, they hire whatever scientists out there. They pay them like, you know, 100K a month. They've got people that, you know, they do analyses for them, whatever. And then these guys, you know, and then at some point, you know, they just pick up the phone, call MW. And then, you know, don't ask me. yesterday or the day before what should you do over here i already told you this weeks ago so don't ask me now i told you already look at this this is a massive bounce but we're gonna talk

No music today. No music.

00:04:50
You know, I don't have a lot of time. No music. Sorry, guys. No music. This was what I was doing while most of you guys were sleeping. I was, you know, it's, you know, okay, okay. So what is the next step? So I was, first of all, what I was eyeing, so I tweeted about this already. You know, this bounce, just keep in mind, you know, I get it. I get it. So this was the bounce. This was the bounce. The bounce to the top was, okay, 10%, 12%. Guys. I understand, you know, when you watch this Kobayashi letter, when you watch all these tweets on X, oh, a market crash, oh, Trump destroyed all the markets. You know, market crash, market crash. This is the level that we're hitting now.

00:05:43
So look where we are, if we would zoom out. Let me take you like this, so you can see better. Okay, let me do another chart. Okay. Let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me. I cannot remove this one, but let me zoom out a bit on the three months. Look where we are. We're just here. This is where we are. So just let's say from 2020, from the Corona crash over here, look where we are. You see where we are? If you would read and believe the crap that they are showing you on Twitter and on the news or whatever, you would think that we were over here somewhere or maybe even over here. Because we have to â€“ I'm just saying, to just get back to the Corona Crush levels, this is just five years ago. Just five years ago. We still need to dump 60%. 60%. So all that news that you've been seeing out there, we dumped 30%. 30% from the top. And, you know, if you read the news, it's like, you know, it's like we went back to the Stone Age.

00:07:24
That's what I'm telling you guys. Don't be fooled. Please don't be fooled by these people. Don't be fooled. Listen, it's not as if I'm bearish. Because why? If I would be bearish, I wouldn't tell you, like I told you in the previous streams, I wouldn't tell you focus on loans. I wouldn't tell you, okay, we hit support. I wouldn't tell you. You have to keep in mind that there is a difference between seeing. Calculating a macro analyze and preparing yourself for the big dangers in trading and investing; there is a big difference in trading trading the lower time frames because nothing goes you know this thing didn't go up in one line, you see we get up down up down, and maybe we'll even go up more, it's possible I'm not ruling that out, but this is just doing your macro analysis.

00:08:19
But for now, On a short time frame, you have to make money. You know, GTC, we make money every day again and again and again and again. And I'm going to show you guys; I'm going to show you guys some altcoins that have been outperforming that I've been sharing with you and I've been preparing you for. Like, listen, guys, these are the altcoins you should trade. These are the altcoins you should buy. These are the altcoins you should, you know. And, you know, I'm always saying they really should make a Netflix documentary about me. Because it really is mind-blowing that I'm not a fundamental expert. I just ain't. And then, you know, I called in December, January. I told you guys about, for example, let me just give you an example.

00:09:08
I told you, listen, guys, Fartcoin is the new PopCat of 2025. And Fartcoin has been outperforming every single, at least the top 100, every single top 100 article out there. And I already told you this in December. It's crazy, guys. You know, I do it on my own. I do it on my own. I'm just alone. I don't own like 30 people working for me or 50, 100. I don't get them. So it's so sick. But let me get back. So basically what I was eyeing in the morning is this. This is what I was eyeing. So we got this dump of 36%. We got this dump was 28%. We got this dump 21%. Are you seeing something? Are you seeing something?

00:10:05
You could go into the mathematics and then you say, okay, this was a difference of 12. And this was a difference of six, so the next move will probably be three. You got me, this is if you want to go into the math, so okay, I do that a lot of time by the way it's just you know I'm crazy, I'm someone always thinking in numbers, you know trying to find structure or whatever, so but let's not talk about that, that's not so important but so there is there is something, or so why I'm showing you this is because just to show you guys that we didn't dump that much. And especially with this, this bounce is huge. Look at this bounce. This bounce is huge, guys.

00:10:59
This is, you know, Trump on the news, you know, by the way, guys. You know, these terrorists and this and that or whatever. It's just noise, in my opinion. You say whatever it is that you want to say. For sure, on the short time frame, it has some impact when that news comes out. But on a bigger picture, whatever. Whatever. It's just whatever. It really does nothing. So, for now, as you guys can see, we made this double. Also, I'll explain to you guys about this double. Boom. Confirmation of support, and then off so now we're coming down a bit and now it's flipping around, but now is the question how deep are we going? So you could see something, you could do something like this, you know, okay we've got this trendline, okay over here, so the next target will probably be around 56,000.

00:11:58
You could do something like that you could also uh take the 50 of this uh 50 of this one uh that could also give you an indication, so if this is uh 21 then around 11 over here, so let's say that this was the half, this is also something that technical analysts, uh, a lot of times use the the the the half of the box, so you see it also over here, so this comes also beautiful together with this one and uh we have more, yes we've got this one, uh, we got this one, so this could also be um maybe want to go to the triple and you know it's all possible but you know it's also why I was preparing you guys, you have to focus on the longs, you have to focus on the longs, you have to focus on the longs as long as we are in this box and above it traveling, you have to focus on the longs because I'm teaching.

00:12:56
you guys how to trade the safe way and where you can get the most you know the most gains the most powerful gains and we're going to talk about those outcomes in a moment because i'm not going to talk too much about this uh let me go to the next one uh this was a one that i was eyeing today and you know i'm putting uh you know i'm trying to connect some dots and putting some some stuff uh you know i'm trying to find the next big move because i want you know this is what i do i try to calculate the next crash that's most of the times what i do is

00:13:30
i always connect try to see when are they going to dump or going to dump very hard so i always try to Be ahead of them so uh, this takes time I told you already, this takes time, so I'm you know while I'm working on it trying to connect the dots, I share some charts with you and let me show you this because this is very important. I shared it already on Twitter. Why is it so important? Because you have to see it like this. So when this downtrend, this downtrend, this is exactly when the markets pumped, when they made a good rise. So Bitcoin and the US market started. So this time, this time, because we came from a local top, local top, this time we didn't.

00:14:22
We didn't, because this time the markets dumped together with the DXY. So they dumped together, so maybe even more interesting is is to find out what happened with the markets on this move up and what happened on the markets when this thing moved up, you know maybe that's even more important than these boxes over here, so what happened so let me tell you over here probably the markets dumped very hard. What is this? From July 21 to October. July 21 to October. Let's see what happened. July 21. Where is July 21? July 21. Over here. July 21 to October. You see this? We had a little bit of bounce over here. But this was the retrace, I think. We came down. We dumped. What is it? We dumped by. You see this?

00:15:21
We dumped by 26%. A 26% dump on this rise. So the problem now is because the DXY went, because we have a bounce now. This is a strong bounce, by the way. So we had this bounce. So we could be, let's say, maybe we could be maybe in a couple of days, we could be back at these levels close to all-time high again. It's possible because we're still bullish. The momentum is bullish for now. But you have to keep in mind that this monster. He's not at top levels. Are you seeing this? So, for sure, we could dump down to here. But, you know, if I would know Trump a little bit as I know him, Trump will, you know, a lot of people are saying, oh, Trump wants to make the dollar weak because that way he can this and that.

00:16:13
F**k that s**it. You know, every time I keep telling myself, okay. don't swear just don't swear and every time I fall in and I swear again, ah you know, I need I need to get myself a box over here and for donation every time when I swear, I put in 100 every time I swear. I think I think I have to do that so let me get back to the chart. So, The fear now is, what if this is going to hold? Because you have to understand me, when MW starts doubting, starts, you know, I'm not doubting the short-term. I'm doubting the long-term. I'm doubting the long-term. And why am I doubting the long term? Because of this chart. Because normally, we should be over here.

00:17:29
Just like we had over here. We should be over here. And we should be over, let's just say something, we should be on a rise. It doesn't matter if it's this rise or it is this rise or this rise. It doesn't matter. We should be at these levels because these levels, when the DXR starts dumping, it will push the markets up. You'll get a lot of momentum. We're not there. Look where we are. Are you seeing where we are? This is where we are. And there is an explanation for this, by the way. The yen, you know. I'm going to save that for another stream. There is an explanation why the DXY is dumping. You know, let's just say that Japan is playing a super, super big role in whatever is happening.

00:18:20
Not the tariffs. Don't give a crap about tariffs. Japan is very important to me. Japan is one of the most. But I've been telling you that for a year now. Japan, you just don't see it. But Japan has got such a big impact on the world economy and on the U. S. economy. You cannot imagine that. So for now, this over here, what we're seeing over here, what if we're going to hold support over here and we're going to rise up again? In my opinion, that will create blood; and my opinion, that will then we go back, testing the box, we're going to test it very strongly. We might lose it, but this is the only so if this thing starts finding momentum, going sideways and going up again, uh, yeah, that will not be good.

00:19:15
Let's just say that that will not be good in my opinion. Maybe the markets could hold, but I don't believe that; I just don't believe that the markets will hold. I think that the markets will bleed. So for me, at this stage, it's, you know, guys, it's very simple. So these are the three boxes over here. Boom, boom, boom. We hit this one. We came down. We're bouncing. Let's see how long we can stay bouncing, how long until the next drop. Because I don't think that we are just going to fly up. Well, let's just say I'm going to be very surprised. Although. We're focusing on loans and making money on loans, you know. At some point, you have to take a break, by the way.

00:19:53
Not at some point, you have to always when you're trading-you have to keep taking profits on these loans, keep taking profits on the loans back again, back again. It's very simple to indicate. We're going to talk about it in a moment, so this is basically what I'm eyeing now and uh for me now, these days, all my eyes are on this chart. You guys don't remember-I know that you guys don't remember You guys don't remember when I was telling you over here that I'm going to flip a lot of money into yen. A lot of my stable goes into the yen. You guys will probably also forget that I took a lot of profits over here. I know that you guys forgot about that. And you guys will probably also forget that I bought back in very heavy over here. And now we're reaching over here. So this is basically, listen, guys, if this thing goes even close to this red zone and we're going to the ultimate final, in my opinion, final bottom. This is when, you know, this is if we got it. Guys, this is just my analysis-I know I'm a sick trader. This is just how I see it. This is how I see it.

00:21:16
Sky's the limit. And it might, maybe not work out because we might even ramp up from here, from these levels. But if we won't, and if we will come back, maybe even make another higher low, but this would be a valid triple, I think that this will happen. I think that we're going to move over here. That's what I think. You know, who cares about what I think? I'm just saying. I'm just saying. This would be a master trade for me. This is the same trade, just like I took over here. I know that you guys probably don't remember this also. You probably don't. The ones that have been with me for some years, they know this. This is the trade I took over here. Have you seen this one?

00:22:03
I've shared it also on Twitter, by the way, guys. You can check it out on my Twitter post. I never remove a Twitter post. Have you seen this triple over here? Have you seen this one? See this one; this is what I share that is the truth of the trade I took-one, two, three... yeah, so it's the same over here. I can make the same chart like this one when I zoom out, but it's the same over here: one, two... I need number three; I need number three. I might not get it, but I need number three. Number three comes-that's when I will, you know, I will do my thing and I will make sick money. Okay, enough, enough, guys. You know, enough.

00:22:55
By the way, guys, for you to understand is when this thing comes up, this is bad for the USD. So when it's bad for the USD, it means it's good for the markets. So that's what I also tweeted about. You have to be cheering Japan. Because Japan, for you as a crypto bank or a stockholder or whatever, Japan is good for you. Because Japan is the biggest enemy at this point of the US dollar for now. And for sure, we've got this one also. This one plays even a bigger role. But look, we are at the red zone. And when we are at the red zone, is this something to be bullish about? I don't think so. So keep this also in mind.

00:23:37
At some point, if the euro starts flipping again, and if you guys would focus on what I was showing you, it's the same like the yen. Are you seeing this? Look. It's the same like the yen. And keep in mind that Europe is now starting to say, okay, we're going to buy very expensive gas from America. Americans are really, you know, these Americans are really gangsters. You know. They first go and tell Europe, okay, you have to make trouble with Russia. Just make trouble with Russia. Just make trouble with them. But why? Because we are saying so. Just make trouble with them. Okay. Don't buy gas or buy oil from them. Just don't. But why? Don't. Just don't. And then America comes back. You know what? We will buy that gas from other sources, the same gas that you were buying very cheap. And now you have to buy them from us. And if you don't buy them from us, we're going to punish you.

00:24:51
Europe told them, okay. So you first bullied us to not buy gas from very cheap? No. So now you're buying that same gas from that same person and, you know.

00:25:13
You're buying the same guys you're selling it for us for double triple okay good for you, you're America well gangsters you know America real gangsters they're real gangsters let's work on some one two it's the same as the end okay enough about this guy I'm going into crypto, crypto, crypto it's all crypto now so so first of all let me talk about this later before I go to bitcoin later by the way guys this uh um I announced it today. This is my new investment. Investment? What are you talking about? Yes, this is my new investment. You know, I just like to **** around with those companies. That's just right. And, you know, it's time to start doing it again. We did it with auction. Now it's time to do it with Relayer.

00:25:59
So, Mr. Koreans, we're going to dance. We're going to play. So MW is playing with you now. You got my attention. You got my full attention now. So, the odds are a little bit with them because of the market sentiment and because of the bounce. But I don't care. Even though that I told you to focus on longs, this is my new challenge. And, you know, I need a challenge, you know, to get things done. Otherwise, it's too boring. So, okay. So push it. Push it! Korea, I know that you're watching by the way. I know that there are two Koreans watching undercover. I know that you watch my streams so I want it over here. Three bucks, $3.

00:26:49
I want these levels over here and donâ€™t be afraid Iâ€™m already in so if you think that you can fool me and just dump it down from here donâ€™t Iâ€™m already in But I want you to push it over here because I need you over here. Because why? This will create a more, you know, the P &L looks much better. You know, the P &L and the gains will be much bigger. So just push it over here. Push it. But donâ€™t think that you can fool me because Iâ€™m already in. So no need to start dumping it. No need. Just keep holding. Keep going, doing whatever it is that youâ€™re doing. Keep doing. So thatâ€™s about layer, guys.

00:27:30
Uh this is on the USDT pair and you know here over here it is two bucks 2. 4, you know this was against uh the the the Korean Crow whatever they call it so this is against UCT so just just bring it bro just come bring it do it do come come I'll be waiting bring it just bring it bring it bring it bring it because Barrow took you know Barrow we we did it twice on Anna it was once And bear I did it twice. Let's see how Leia is going to do. Come. Come, baby. Come. Come. Come. Show me. Show me the money. Show me the money. Look at this. Look at this. I've seen this, guys. Look at this. Look. Look at this shot. Look at this. This is just one big Ponzi pump scheme. That's what this is. These guys will dump this thing so hard.

00:28:35
You just have to be educated. You need to know how to leverage trade. If you know how to leverage trade a little bit, you're going to kill it on this one. You just need to know how to do it. You just need to know. And how do you know how to do it? You have to be trading on Bloven or Butanex. DM me your UID. 100k trading volume is nothing by the way, and yeah, DM your UID and you'll get access to the trading course vids; you know you watch them like a hundred times-I don't care how many times you're gonna watch them, you're gonna listen to me, don't think that you're smarter, just listen to me in those vids. Do exactly as I'm telling you over there: how to leverage trade.

00:29:25
That's it. That's it. So, Korea, come on, Korea! Come on, Korea! You can do it. You can do this. You can do this. Come on. Come on. You can do this. Maybe you can even, maybe they can even ramp it up to three bucks. Why not? Why not? You greedy freaks. Why not? Come on. Maybe they can even push it to three bucks. That would be great if they can push it to three bucks. And I'm in. So this is for me, no trade. This is for me, lay it's for me an investment. I'm investing money over here. You know, I'm investing money. I forget about it. I let it run. Doesn't have my focus. I don't give a crap until I show you. That's what's going to happen.

00:30:14
So let me go to, let me go, let me go to Bitcoin. Let me go to Bitcoin, Bitcoin, Bitcoin. Oh, I love it! You know, I remember this preview; you know, you know it's; it sounds this is; let me ask all of you guys that are in the stream right now, i know, i know, i understand because why you guys are all humans, you guys are no bots, you're not AI bots, you're humans, you've got a feeling and emotions, you've got to really get everything! I know that the previous stream when you know, when you see this thing come back and I start telling you guys, if you're not gonna buy now; When are you going to buy? And then, you know, while I'm saying that to you and you're seeing the red, so forget about this.

00:30:59
You're not seeing this. But this candle was not here. This candle was not here. Guys, if you're not going to buy here, when are you going to buy? Especially if you're 100% in cash, you have to buy. He's throwing 20, 30%, whatever. AMW we cannot buy, it's going down, the markets are going down, guys please, please, please, please just listen to me, you need to buy, you need to buy the blood, buy the freaking blood, we're hitting support, no! No, I cannot buy my feelings and my emotions. Everything is telling me we're going down because Trump is putting in tariffs and I'm reading the news and we're going to crash.

00:32:11
Just listen. Just freaking listen. How many times do I need to repeat myself? Just freaking listen! Listen! Listen! Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. You have to listen. Because you have to listen. Sing this guy, sing this. Then days later, oh. Oh, yeah, yeah, we're pumped up again. Yeah, we're going up again. Oh, yeah, well, MW, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you were right again, MW. Yeah, you were right again when you were telling us to buy. It's already too late. And why didn't you buy when I told you to buy? Because I was afraid. Hmm. Why were you afraid? Yeah, because, you know, I'm very scared when markets go down. But, you know, But, you know, when markets go up and they are at top levels and at FOMO levels, I'm not so scared anymore.

00:33:13
You know, that's when I have the guts and, you know, that's when I buy. But why do you buy? Because, you know, I just open up my Twitter and, you know, I go through my feed and I see that everyone is bullish. And, you know, everyone is calling for 20x, 50x altcoins, 100x altcoins, you know. All my favorite crypto gurus are telling us to buy ETH, Bitcoin, you know, and they're saying that this is just the beginning and, you know, crypto is going to the moon and, you know, Trump is coming and, you know, and then they show us, you know, I look at Look On Chain and I see a lot of spotted ETFs are buying even more Bitcoin. And, you know, my favorite crypto account, you know, Michael Saylor, he's always buying Bitcoin. So, you know, yeah, yeah. So, you know, so. That's when I'm not scared at the top. No. Why are you not scared at the top? You know, because, you know, the whole world is buying crypto. So why wouldn't I buy crypto? I just go all in. Yes.

00:34:37
It's so hard, so hard to fight people and they agreed it's so hard, so uh again guys, again guys, so we're bouncing very beautifully, let's see how you're on, you know, look at this, look at this, look at this, look at this, let me do, let me, let me do some amateur, some amateur uh and uh ta with you guys, some amateur, this is this is amateur ta, this is this is called the moon level, you know, called the moon level, look at this, oh we're traveling into this falling wet, oh I told you, I told you it was the bottom over here, I told you you know, I'm gonna do one live stream, you know, we're gonna put in the fibs, We're going to put in the RSIs.

00:35:31
We're going to put in the stochastic. We're going to put in some heat maps. We're going to put in some nice, you know, these horizontal volume sticks. Yes, we're going to put them all on our charts. I'm going to do one live stream for you guys with all these fucking tools on. Why not? The question is this: Because if you were smart people, if you guys would have brains in your heads and you know how to logically think, If you see me never using any of those tools and I'm outperforming every freaking, every single one of those TA guys on Twitter or on YouTube, what is the conclusion that has to come into your mind? I would say I will never, ever put on a fucking fib, stochastic aerosol, a heat map or whatever the fuck out there on my chart, because it's just a lot of fucking crap. Because if there is one trader not using all of those tools and he beats every single one of those Einsteins out there, why the fuck am I using those tools?

00:36:46
Okay. So let me show you guys my tool. I'm going to show you guys my tool. This is my tool, the only tool that I use. Oh, my tool. Look at my tool, guys. Look at it. Look at it. Look at it. Oh, we hit it over here. Reject it down. We hit it over here. Reject it down. Even Trump with his 90 fucking percent, 90, no, not 90 percent, 90 days of no, no, no, you know, no, no terrorists or whatever crap he's shared over there. Even then, it hit the indicator and dumbed down. Even then, it hit the indicator and dummed down. Kaboom, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom. This indicator has no relation to FIPS. This indicator has no relation to stochastic as RSI, to RSI, to. No, it doesn't.

00:37:54
Okay, enough, let me see Paxi for a big for one moment and that's Paxi Paxi Paxi Paxi. By the way, guys, I'm gonna say No, when this one. See this one on the indicator; look at this one. Are you seeing these guys? I know you guys are not seeing-I think this support zone indicator bitcoin indicator boom! You can make 100k, 200k, 500k based on for the high volume traders trading bitcoin that's it that's it. The high volume traders sometimes when you're confident, you're seeing it and it's connecting; boom! boom! going heavy, going heavy; make 100k, 200k, 300k why not 50k, 70k, 80k, 90k? Do it just do it, put a stop loss and do it. Go on, maybe you're gonna hit your stop loss one time or two times but you're gonna nail it eight-seven-eight out of times; make a lot of money.

00:39:13
You just have to listen. So um, yes we're gonna talk about uh the altcoin shared on GTC Insider so first of all we're gonna start with this one showing a lot of volume gas okay, okay guys I only have no clue gossip; I think this is an old coin I don't know gas whatever I don't know, guys. I'm just telling you there's a lot of volume going on over here so uh this level this level, okay oh yeah. This is beautiful, by the way. Look at this, where's this, what's this? Go away. This one, seeing this block over here, guys. Very long accumulation. We hit it now. It's reacting out of it. So do some research on gas; I don't know, try to get more out of it using the Indy. So the next one is SNT, SNT. Oh, okay, whatever doesn't it? I really have no clue. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Oh,

00:40:59
baby, baby, baby, baby. This is looking so good. Chart-wise, this is looking so good, guys. I really have no clue if this thing has got some life in it or what it is or what they do. But do some research on this S & T, guys. I don't know what it is, but wait a minute. Let me check for a moment. Let me see. What is this? What is now when I see a chart that interests me? That's when I start doing research on some crappy note, not liking that some research on it, whatever. It's hitting support levels. I'm not interested in it. Steam. Steam, baby, Steam. Oh, I love Steam. I love Steam. This is like a payment coin doing payment crap to whatever payment network. So, Steam. Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam. Oh, I love Steam.

00:42:23
Guys, all I have to say is keep an eye on Steam. I'm liking Steam, I'm gonna be very honest with you-I like, I love Steam. Steam is showing some nice power over here, guys. And it dumped-this was a huge dump by the way, by Steam. I don't know why, but oh whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Almost 80 down, this is massive. So uh, guys do some research on Steam, trade the indie. I think that Steam is looking really, really... these are the coins that you know, if the fundamentals are good and uh, you know, and the team is still operative. These are the coins that I like to buy, by the way. This is it, this is it, this is it, this is it!

00:43:07
Let me put an alarm over here-example check out Steam showing some power, then we got this Vine, okay uh. This is in my opinion, if I'm correct, me if I'm wrong but Vine is a meme coin, shield by uh Elon Musk, that's that simple. That's what I know about Vine, he likes to tweet about you know he you know it's sometimes very crazy that these people that are working at very high levels in governments have the time to shield meme coins on Twitter. Are you feeling me? Are you guys feeling me? You know I just don't get it. Where do they find the time for that? I just don't get it. But either way, it's a nice bottom accumulation. This thing could pump especially it's if Musk will start uh doing whatever it is that he's doing.

00:44:05
You guys will you really need to uh uh you really you really you really. Oh, I didn't remove that one by the way. So you you guys really need to to trade. The indie this indicator the indicator will make your money on these coins, you know. I made trading course with how to trade meme coins like a pro, uh, guys. This is basically, uh, maybe uh the most important, uh, training course that you're gonna watch because if you are going to trade meme coins with the indicator just like I educated you on the leverage training course, then you can make life-changing money in no time, so yes. Next one, touch? I don't know what that is; I would say cut the crap out of it; I don't know what that is, that's whatever that's just cut the crap out of it, use the indicator do whatever it is that you want to do.

00:45:09
Oh, caddy. Caddy is getting dumped, getting rugged, okay? Is this a surprise? No, this is just you know. Caddy could be like my bara girlfriend; caddy could also be my girlfriend; she isn't my girlfriend because she wasn't pretty enough, but whatever. Now, caddy could be one of my girlfriends, so someone is dumping caddy. Actually, by the way, guys, this is a monster! You have to remember that you know we call the top over here-this rug. They rug a lot of people over here and then they dump down. But this thing, when it dumps, when it shows volume, there's a big community behind it. And they like to pump this thing very hard. So you have to just keep in mind that since I called the bottom, I told you to focus on longs, this coin did 66%.

00:45:59
So keep this in mind, guys. This Oxygen can pump very hard. Use the Indy and give it a check. Oh, Argo. Argo, Argo, Argo is one of those shillers coins. So, you know, all those big accounts, they like to shill Argo. I don't know why they like to shill Argo. Maybe they're getting paid. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they've got some, maybe they gave them some coins, free coins. I don't know. I'm just guessing. I'm just saying something. But there's always a reason for someone shilling something, you know. And it's not the fundamentals. Let me tell you that. It's not the fundamentals, guys. So, whatever. I don't chase these pumps. I would only be interested in shorting the crap out of them.

00:46:51
Maybe this is one of those coins that you could short the crap out of. Not now, but soon. No, you can make some nice gains on this one. So, but again, we're focusing on loans, but you know. But you know actually if you want to, you have to see it like this. So if you got a short something, why would you short our goal if you've got later? No, I feel like, 'Why would you know this is just a 100 million market cap, you know made a nice wrong pop? Maybe they can hold it down because now so, you know if I'm gonna put a dime into Argo, short why wouldn't I just short-layer that's my opinion, so um well, Mubarak to everyone, so uh I'd Mubarak you know this. I think this is just CC now CZ, uh he's now the advisor of the Pakistani government for crypto yeah, well you know what, me that's all I have to say and then auction.

00:48:01
Thank you Korea. That's all I have to say. Thank you, Korea. Thank you. You made so much money on non-auctions. Then I wanted to show you guys this, by the way, guys. Are you seeing this? Listen, do you guys understand why I'm about... no, not about. I am by far the best in crypto town. If it's about altcoins, if it's about fundamentals, I'm a fundamental expert, but I'm better than them. Why am I better than them? Because, you know, I've been screaming for months, 'you have to trade.' You want to make money? Yes. You want to make money? You want to make serious money? Trade Fartcoin. Fartcoin is the best. It's the pop cat of 2024. So this is Fartcoin is 25.

00:48:54
I said it and I said it and I said it and I said it. You guys just have to listen. Look at this. So basically, what happened is this: let me tell you; let me show what happened. So since the dump when we flip bullish, this thing more than doubled. If you bought it when uh I was buying at the previous dump, you are at the 4x now. Remember the previous dump, the other dump? You know, when we bought in Fartcoin? I showed you the P&L, the 4,000%. It's now, by the way, running around 8,000 or 9,000. I need to share that P&L, by the way. It's around that. But, you know, I'm going to take profits, by the way.

00:49:40
I'm going to take more than 90% out of the position. But, you know, that's just me. That's what I am. I don't give a fuck about Fartcoin. I only give a about the amount of money I'm making if it's tomorrow, another one you know it's just like better every day there's another girlfriend, I don't give a [care], I just follow the money. So first of all, let me show you this resistance zone, but I think that fartcorn will dump earlier, so we got, first of all, the one back, one back. So uh, we're getting close, guys. So when we're getting close to this, you have to be careful, don't, don't you bought over here, you made a four or five X congrats that's simple, I know that a lot of you guys uh own fart going from the 20 cents so don't start uh hiding over there as if you don't have father and I know that you guys have.

00:50:37
So if you, if you, if you made a four or five weeks, congrats, and four or five weeks take the debt at least liquidate uh let's say 60, 70, 80 percent of Your position and if you're still bullish or fat when you think that it's gonna moon in one line which is possible by the way but if you think that this thing will just moon in one line uh you just hold 30 40 percent and then well make money on that one but you know you have to be careful I'm telling you you have to be super super careful I'm repeating myself you have to be super super careful okay guys well um I think I'm gonna close it up I think that It was a nice stream again and again and again and again and again.

00:51:24

You know, when I was telling the guys, it's not about the tech, it's about money. Make money, don't get, no! No, MW, no! It's like, it's like, it's like I'm beating their kids or something. That's how angry they are at me when I tell them, listen, guys, all these articles, it's not about the tech. No, MW, shut up, shut up, go away, it's the tech, you know. It's, it's, it's, it's really, it's really, it's, it's. It's really mind-blowing. It's really mind-blowing. Let me see the chat if there is something interesting to share with you guys.
