Trading Course 3.0 – How to Trade Memecoins as a Pro (Ninja Style Analysis)
Trading Style
The trader’s style in Course 3.0 is highly momentum-driven and adaptive, with a focus on volatile memecoins. He trades like a “professional” by actively taking positions in both directions (long and short) depending on what the chart shows, rather than holding a biased view. This style emphasizes technical indicator signals over hype or narratives – “trade what you see, not what you feel” is a core mantra inherited from earlier courses. The instructor targets big trending moves (up or down) and is quick to flip bias when the trend shifts, making multiple in-and-out trades as needed to capture profit from every significant price swing.
This “ninja” style is stealthy and strategic. The trader often splits large positions across three exchanges to avoid showing his full hand to any single market. By executing concurrently on platforms like “Wix,” “Bitunex/B2Nex,” and “Blowfin” (the transcript’s terms for three non-KYC exchanges), he prevents market makers from easily countering his trades. This multi-exchange approach, combined with using an exclusive “MW indicator” for timing, defines his unique style. He relies on this indicator (touted as “the best indicator in the world”) to pinpoint entries and exits with precision. Overall, the trading style is proactive and technical, centered on exploiting memecoin volatility through disciplined, indicator-based tactics while remaining flexible and not wed to any bullish or bearish narrative.
Strategy Type
The strategy taught is a form of indicator-based trend trading with breakout-retest logic tailored to high-volatility coins. The instructor focuses on identifying “bottom formations” to go long and overextended all-time highs to short (with caution). In practice, the strategy uses the MW indicator as a trend filter: the trader waits for price to break above the indicator and retest it as support before longing, or break below and retest as resistance before shorting. This ensures entries are aligned with clear momentum shifts rather than guesswork. For example, in the video he shows a memecoin chart (“Bonk”) that had been falling: once it broke below the indicator and retested from beneath, that was a confirmation to short and ride the downward move. Conversely, when the same coin found a bottom and closed above the indicator then retested it, that retest was the cue to enter a long position for the uptrend. This breakout-and-retest framework is the crux of the strategy.
The strategy is momentum-centric – it performs best when a coin has strong FOMO-driven volume. The instructor stresses that “when FOMO hits in, volume hits in, momentum hits in, this indicator will make you rich…you have to act accordingly”. In other words, the method seeks to capture explosive moves during hype cycles. It’s applied to memecoins because they “are the best to trade with the indicator to make the most money” due to their extreme volatility and capital inflows during hype phases. Part of the strategy involves multi-timeframe alignment (explained later) and deliberately scaling into winning trades. As a trend progresses favorably, the “real traders with balls” will add to their positions at subsequent indicator signals, often opening new longs/shorts on different exchanges for each leg of the move. This pyramiding approach maximizes gains during a sustained trend, essentially compounding a winning trade.
Finally, the strategy includes contrarian shorting of hype peaks. The team behind the course prepares to “short the crap out of all these Ponzi FOMO coins” once they show topping signals. The instructor makes it clear that shorting should only be done when the indicator confirms a reversal, because attempting to short a coin still in “beast mode” uptrend will get you “100% wrecked” if you’re too early. Thus, the strategy is a blend of trend-following (ride the wave safely as long as it lasts) and timely counter-trend plays (attack the reversal when momentum flips), all guided by the indicator’s structure.
Timeframe Focus
Multi-timeframe analysis is a key aspect of the trader’s approach. He explicitly names the daily, 4-hour, 1-hour, 15-minute, and 5-minute charts as his favorite timeframes for using the indicator. Each timeframe serves a purpose:
* Higher Timeframes (Daily & 4H): These are used for bigger swings and for traders who cannot watch the market constantly. On the 4H chart, one can make “huge gains” with just a few trades, as trends are more sustained. The instructor even suggests that those with busy lives stick to the 4H – for example, a 4H long trade can simply be trailed with a stop and held for a large move without needing rapid adjustments. The daily isn’t demonstrated in detail in this video, but it likely provides overall trend context (major support/resistance levels for the indicator).

* Intermediate (1H): The 1-hour chart is described as “a bit more choppy”, requiring more active management. On 1H, the same indicator strategy is applied but with more frequent exits and entries. The video shows that on 1H, one might get stopped out (in profit) and then re-enter on the next signal multiple times as the trend zig-zags. This timeframe is for traders who can monitor trades more often and want to capitalize on each smaller swing within the larger trend.

* Lower Timeframes (15M & 5M): These are used for scalping and fine-tuning entries. The instructor demonstrates on a 15-minute chart how a potential short setup can be identified in real-time, with the 15M indicator showing a rejection while the 1H indicator “backs it up” as higher-level resistance. Essentially, he draws key levels from the 1H/4H on the 15M chart to know where to take profits or expect bounces. The 5M was not shown in detail in the transcript, but given it’s listed as a favorite, it likely serves for very short-term entry timing or quick scalp trades during intense volatility. In earlier training, he warned that on 15M/5M you must “take the green when you see it” (take profits quickly) because of how volatile and noisy those timeframes are.

Overall, the trader zooms in and out between timeframes to plan and manage trades. A typical use case described is: identify a setup on 4H or 1H, execute on 15M (for precise entry) and even 5M if needed, then manage the position using the appropriate chart (e.g., trail stops on 15M swings if scalping, or on 4H swings if swinging). This multi-scale focus ensures that regardless of whether one is a part-time trader or an active day trader, the indicator strategy can be applied. It’s a versatile approach: 4H/Daily provide the big picture trend, 1H gives actionable signals with moderate pace, and 15M/5M allow aggressive exploitation of momentum.
Risk Management Philosophy
Risk management is paramount in the Ninja trading framework, and it’s addressed through strict rules:
   * Always use a Stop Loss: Every trade is protected by a stop. The stop is typically placed just beyond the indicator line or key level used for entry confirmation. For example, if shorting at an indicator resistance on 15M, the stop goes slightly above the indicator line (he suggests a cushion of 1-2% beyond the line to avoid getting wicked out by minor spikes). If price instead closes above that level, that’s a definitive exit signal – “if it closes above it, you’re out… It’s that simple”. This reflects a disciplined willingness to cut losses quickly. The instructor repeatedly urges not to fear a small loss: a tiny hit is trivial compared to the huge gains from big moves, so you “take that small loss and wait for your next opportunity”.

   * “Green never turns into red”: This is touted as lesson number one in the GTC community. It means a trade that is in profit should never be allowed to turn into a loss. The practical implementation is to secure profits as they accrue. The trader raises the stop-loss into profit territory as soon as feasible, effectively trailing stops behind the price. In the example given on the 4H uptrend, as the trade moved up, the stop was incrementally moved from the entry level to higher and higher levels (each time locking in more profit) instead of keeping it at the original point. Eventually the stop is deep in profit such that if hit, the trade still nets a gain. This way, worst-case scenario, the trade exits green. The philosophy is also seen in guidance to take partial profits regularly: e.g., the team that shorted took profits three times on the way down, and traders are advised to “take profits… leave something running” for the next target but bank enough such that remaining position going wrong won’t erase overall profit.

   * No Overexposure / Avoiding Liquidation: The instructor had earlier taught to avoid liquidation at all costs (for leveraged trades). In Course 2.0 he emphasized keeping leverage low enough or adding margin so that your liquidation price stays far away. In this video, rather than explicit mention of liquidation, the idea is evident in splitting trades across exchanges and cutting losses quickly. By not putting all capital on one trade on one platform, the risk of a single exchange’s wick liquidating the position is minimized. He even recommends a specific exchange (B2Nex) because it has “whale spike protections” to prevent random wicks from liquidating retail traders. The overarching principle is protect your capital – “you cannot win a trade if they get you out of the game” as said in Course 1.0. This means using all tools (lower leverage, multiple accounts, reliable exchanges, stops) to survive any single adverse swing.

   * Controlled Position Sizing & Volume Tactics: For high-volume traders (those moving 6-7 figure sums), the coach insists on splitting orders into multiple exchanges and even indicates there’s a somewhat different style for them. He explicitly says if you trade with only a few hundred or small five figures, one exchange is fine; but if trading with 100k+ size, never put it all in one place. This is risk management against slippage and manipulation. The strategy of adding to positions is also managed carefully – adds are done “slowly” or at specific levels, and only up to the point of invalidation (for instance, in Course 1 he showed how to add to a short as price goes up only until a certain breakout point, beyond which you must stop out to avoid a catastrophic loss).

   * Psychological Risk Control: He encourages a mindset that manages risk: no greed and no fear. From a risk perspective, greed can lead to not taking profit and turning a winner into a loser, or oversizing a trade; fear can lead to cutting winners too early or hesitating to re-enter after a loss. His remedy is a planful approach – if you’re satisfied with the money made, just take it and don’t second-guess (“No greed…just take the damn money” he says emphatically). And if a trade setup is there, don’t be afraid to execute it or to take a small stop if wrong. This psychological discipline pairs with the technical stops to form a robust risk management philosophy.

In summary, the risk management is about limiting downside (small controlled losses) and maximizing upside (riding trends with trailing stops and scaling out). Capital preservation techniques like diversified execution and avoidance of being caught in exchange gimmicks (wicks, counter-trade by market makers) are also a unique part of his methodology.
Psychological Profile
The psychological profile encouraged by the instructor is that of a disciplined, fearless, and unbiased trader – essentially a “ninja” mindset. Key traits include:
      * No Emotional Bias: Traders are urged to detach from bullish or bearish bias and stay flexible. He criticizes those who listen to permabulls or doom-sayers, noting that clinging to one narrative makes retailers weak and prone to losses. The proper mindset is to “believe your eyes, not the hype”. In Course 2 he stressed this: “trade based on what the chart is showing, not what you hope or feel”. This cultivates an emotionally neutral approach – seeing the market objectively.

      * Discipline and Patience: The trading plan is systematic, so the trader must patiently wait for the indicator confirmations rather than impulsively jumping in. Even in a fast-moving memecoin market, the guidance is to wait for the break/retest signals. Patience is also evident in how the group handles the memecoin frenzy: they take many small trades “in and out” and wait for the big jackpot short at the right time. The ability to stick to the plan and not chase every blip requires discipline. When satisfied with profit, a disciplined trader exits without regret, exemplified by the story of a member who calmly said “I’m out, I don’t care [if it goes higher]” after making nearly $600k.

      * Courage and Confidence: The instructor speaks to traders who have “the balls” to add to winning positions – implying a level of courage to push a good trade further in a calculated way. There is confidence in the system (he often reiterates how powerful the indicator is, giving a sense of conviction). Importantly, this is not reckless bravado but controlled aggression; for instance, having the courage to re-enter trades after taking profits, or to execute a short at the peak when everyone else is euphoric. He wants traders to trust the strategy (and by extension, trust themselves when following it).

      * Greed Control and Humility: “No greed” is a mantra repeated multiple times. The psychological aim is to avoid the classic retail pitfall of getting greedy and over-staying a trade or doubling down carelessly. By advocating taking profit when content, he instills a form of humility – being satisfied with enough and not always lusting for more. This mindset helps in preserving gains and reducing stress. It’s also tied to gratitude; he celebrates when students make life-changing money and doesn’t demand anything from them except to share their success stories with him for motivation. That attitude encourages traders to focus on their own progress rather than compare or become overly ambitious.

      * Resilience and Quick Recovery: If a trade goes wrong or a small stop is hit, the trader is taught to shake it off and move on to the next opportunity. There’s an underlying mindset of resilience – losses are kept small so that the psychological impact is minimal, allowing the trader to remain confident and alert for the next setup. The phrase “don’t worry about those small losses” captures this resilience; the big wins make them inconsequential, so the trader remains emotionally steady.

      * Professionalism: The overall psychological profile is to think and act like a professional, not an amateur. Professionals follow a system, manage risk, and aren’t swayed by popular emotion. He contrasts the “professional stuff” his team does with what “shillers and influencers” entice amateurs to do (chasing 5x gains on random calls). The implication is to treat trading as a serious business – focusing on data and strategy rather than gambling on rumors. He even shows a kind of mentorship pride, encouraging members to DM him their success. This fosters a community support atmosphere, reinforcing positive psychology: seeing peers succeed with the method builds confidence and reduces self-doubt.

In essence, the desired psychological profile is a trader who is confident but not arrogant, disciplined but not fearful, aggressive but not greedy. They trust the system, cut losses without second thought, take profits without regret, and remain adaptable to whatever the market does.
Tools Used
Technical Tool – The “MW Indicator”: The central tool in this trading approach is a proprietary indicator frequently referred to as the MW indicator. It is the basis for all trade signals. While the exact formula isn’t described, from its usage it behaves like a combined trend and momentum indicator that plots key levels on the chart (possibly something akin to a moving average or supertrend with support/resistance behavior). The instructor claims no other indicator works better, challenging anyone to show him a superior one. This indicator provides clear visual cues: traders look for price to be above or below it and how price interacts (holds or rejects) at the indicator line. It’s essentially the lens through which all price action is interpreted in this course. Charts are marked with it on multiple timeframes, and it simplifies decision-making (e.g., “above indicator = bullish, below = bearish” with appropriate confirmations).
Exchanges and Platforms: The trader uses and recommends multiple crypto exchanges, notably:
         * “Wix” (Weeks/WOO X) – a non-KYC trading platform.

         * “Bitunex” (B2NX) – another exchange; highlighted for its unique whale spike protection feature that safeguards retail traders from sudden wicks.

         * “Blowfin” (Blovin/Blofin) – a third exchange used in rotation.

         * Binance – mentioned as well, though unlike the others it typically requires KYC; possibly used via an unverified account with limited withdrawal or simply noted as a major platform.

All three (WOO X, Bitunex, Blofin) are touted as the “best three non-KYC exchanges in the world” and traders in the community are strongly encouraged to open accounts on all of them. Using these exchanges in tandem is considered part of the trading toolkit to execute the strategy at scale without issues. The instructor also notes that each exchange’s trading app/interface has improved or is good (Course 1.0 praised the updates to “Weeks” app), which suggests ease of use is a factor.
Charting & Analysis Tools: While not explicitly named, it’s implied that charting software (likely TradingView or similar) is used to apply the MW indicator and draw support/resistance lines. He demonstrates drawing horizontal lines at higher-timeframe indicator levels (e.g., marking 1H or 4H indicator positions on a 15M chart). These lines help visualize where to take profit or where another timeframe’s trend might impose support/resistance. The act of “inverting the chart” was also mentioned (to see downward patterns as upward ones), which is a feature in charting platforms to flip the price scale – a tool to help recognize short setups without bias.
Communication and Community Tools: The trader references several communication channels:
            * Twitter: He often provides updates on market conditions (e.g., noting when Wall Street is pumping markets in Course 2.0) and has a linktree in his Twitter bio for all exchange links. So following his Twitter is part of staying informed.

            * Private Groups (Free and Paid): He mentions a “Free Private Group” and the “Game Trading Crypt” paid group. These groups receive his calls (trade signals) and educational content. Active participation in these groups is encouraged (members not actively trading might be removed from the free group as per his warning). The groups likely use Telegram or Discord (not stated explicitly, but common for crypto communities). They serve as a tool for signal distribution and collective learning – e.g., he references calls given in the paid group and members sharing PnL screenshots via DMs.

            * Livestreams and Videos: The course itself is delivered via video, and he also does live streams. In Course 2.0 he referenced a live stream discussing resistance levels. These are educational tools the community uses to stay aligned with the strategy.

Risk Management Tools: Aside from the exchanges and stops, a subtle tool is position tracking and P&L monitoring. He encourages traders to share P&L (profit and loss) screenshots, not for ego, but to verify success and possibly for mentorship. This implies using whatever tools (exchange UI or journaling) to track performance is part of the practice.
In summary, the toolkit comprises:
               * The MW indicator on a charting platform (primary analysis tool).

               * Multiple exchange accounts for trade execution (to distribute orders and mitigate technical risks).

               * Stop-loss orders set on exchanges (a fundamental tool for risk control).

               * Group communication channels for signals and support (Twitter, private chat groups).

               * Possibly personal trading journals or logs (implied by the emphasis on reviewing P&L).

All these tools work in unison: for example, a trader might get an alert from the group about a setup, open TradingView to check the indicator across timeframes, draw key lines, then execute the trade on WOO X, Bitunex, and Blofin simultaneously, placing stops accordingly. This integrated use of tools defines the professional setup of the strategy.
Execution Preference
The execution model favored is highly proactive and hands-on. The trader prefers manual execution with precision timing over any passive approach. Key execution preferences include:
                  * Confirmation Entries: There’s a clear preference for entering trades after confirmation signals rather than predictive entries. For instance, rather than shorting a coin just because it’s high, he waits for the indicator to signal a break in momentum (e.g., a close below support or a failed retest). Similarly, longs are taken not simply at a guessed bottom, but when price action confirms a bottom via the indicator. This means entries often happen on the retest of a level – a patient but decisive style. He even notes one could wait for a candle close beyond a level for extra confirmation; if that happens against the trade idea, you simply don’t enter or you exit if you were in.

                  * Immediate Stop Placement: Every trade is executed with a stop-loss in place from the start, typically a few percent beyond the entry trigger as buffer. This suggests the use of stop orders (for exits) in conjunction with market or limit orders for entries. For example, an execution might be: price touches the indicator on a 15m chart and shows rejection → trader opens a short (possibly a limit order at that level or market if urgency) → immediately sets a stop-loss slightly above the indicator line. If price instead breaks through, the stop will take them out quickly. This one-two action (enter, set stop) is done for every position as a rule.

                  * Active Trade Management: Once in a trade, the trader manages it actively rather than setting and forgetting. Trailing the stop manually is a key behavior: as the trade goes in favor, the stop is moved up/down to lock in profit behind new price structure. There isn’t mention of using automatic trailing stop orders; it sounds more manual – e.g., “your stop loss was here… now your stop loss is over here”, indicating the trader adjusts it as new highs/lows form. He also advocates taking partial profits at interim targets (especially on large positions). The example given: the team took profit three times on a short — likely scaling out portions of the position at different drop levels. So execution-wise, positions are trimmed as they become profitable, not held in full until the final exit.

                  * Scaling In (Pyramiding): The execution preference leans towards adding to winners rather than the classic single entry. The “beast” traders will execute an initial entry, then when the next bullish signal appears (for a long trade) they execute another long on a different exchange, and maybe a third one at the next signal. Each add-on position is given its own stop (often just below the indicator for that timeframe) so that each leg is independently protected. This staggered execution means the trader is not all-in at once; they increase exposure as confidence in the move increases. It’s an advanced execution technique to maximize gains on strong trends while controlling risk on each incremental entry.

                  * Multi-Exchange Order Placement: As noted, the trader executes the same trade on multiple exchanges in parallel. In practice, this could mean if he wants a $300k position, he’ll execute $100k on Exchange A, $100k on Exchange B, $100k on Exchange C (instead of $300k on one). The transcript describes an example: one position was opened on “Blovin”, the next on “Weeks”, the next on “B2Next”, each triggered by the indicator as the price kept rising. This requires comfort with managing several exchange interfaces at once or using tools that can sync orders across exchanges (not mentioned, so likely manual via multiple screens or app). The preference indicates sophisticated order execution to evade slippage or manipulation – a ninja tactic to remain agile and anonymous in the market.

                  * Leverage Use: The execution often involves leveraged trades (20x, 30x leverage were cited in examples). High leverage is used to amplify gains, but it’s paired with the tight risk management (stops, small losses) to avoid blowing up. The fact he calculates P&L on 20x/30x suggests he often uses those levels and expects traders to use leverage prudently. At the same time, he notes you can execute on spot or leverage as per preference – spot trading is fine if one has a big capital (to still yield large absolute gains), but leverage is the norm for getting more from smaller capital.

                  * Frequent Position Flips: The style of execution isn’t to sit in one position for a very long time, especially on lower timeframes. The video illustrates a sequence on the 1H where a trader exits a long and immediately flips to a short when the indicator flips, then exits that short and flips long when momentum returns up. This means the trader is always monitoring the indicator and ready to execute a reversal trade if conditions warrant. The execution preference is thus opportunistic: being in the market during valid signal periods and in cash during uncertain periods. There’s no hesitation to “just get out” if conditions change, or to jump back in on a new signal.

In summary, the execution preference is manual, granular control of trades: enter on confirmation, use stops, actively manage and adjust, scale in/out, and spread orders across venues. The trader acts almost like a tactician orchestrating multiple moves rather than a one-and-done order placer. This requires focus and quick decision-making, very much in line with the “ninja” metaphor – nimble and precise execution to capitalize on memecoin volatility while strictly controlling risk.
Unique Insights and Teaching Nuances
Course 3.0 builds on the foundation of Courses 1.0 and 2.0, reinforcing core principles but also introducing new concepts and emphases. Notable distinct insights and nuances in this third video include:
                     * Memecoins as Prime Targets: Unlike earlier modules which covered general trading concepts, Course 3.0 zeroes in on memecoins. The instructor explicitly states that “meme coins are ruling crypto at this moment” and are the best assets for the indicator strategy due to their explosive moves. This focus is a shift in nuance – previous courses mentioned memecoins (e.g., Popcat in Course 1.0) but here he frames trading memecoins as a professional opportunity in itself. He even notes this is the fifth cycle of memecoin mania and encourages traders to accept that reality and profit from it. This context sets a more urgent and opportunistic tone in Course 3.0 compared to earlier lessons.

                     * All-Time-High Shorts vs. Bottom Longs: The video highlights a straightforward but powerful insight: go long on clear bottoms and short on clear tops. While this sounds obvious, the nuance is in how it’s executed with the indicator. He teaches that many memecoin charts follow similar patterns and that one should focus longs on “bottom formations” and consider shorts on those that are “at all-time highs… but you have to be careful”. The careful shorting of euphoric peaks (with confirmation) is especially emphasized in this course – tying into the community’s plan to take “big, big, big shorts” on multiple memecoins soon. Earlier courses urged not being one-directional, but this is more specific tactical guidance on which kinds of setups to target, making it a new teaching nuance.

                     * Multi-Timeframe Mastery: While multi-timeframe analysis underpins all these courses, Course 3.0 provides a real-time demonstration of it. The instructor seamlessly moves from 4H to 1H to 15M to show how to enter and manage a trade. He teaches the trick of drawing higher timeframe indicator levels onto lower timeframe charts to coordinate entries and exits. This concrete example of blending timeframes (e.g., knowing when a 15M short should take profit because the 1H support is nearby) is a nuanced technique not deeply illustrated in prior videos. It shows a maturation of the framework – not just looking at multiple timeframes, but actively using one timeframe’s information to inform another’s execution plan.

                     * Aggressive Pyramiding on Multiple Exchanges: The concept of adding to positions was present in Course 1.0 (mostly in context of managing leverage and DCAing losers carefully), but Course 3.0 showcases adding to winning positions in a very aggressive yet structured manner. The nuance here is opening each added position on a different exchange to avoid detection and to leverage each platform’s liquidity. He describes seasoned traders opening one long on Exchange A, then as the price keeps confirming, opening another on Exchange B, then on Exchange C. This multi-exchange pyramid for trend continuation is a distinct tactic highlighted in video 3. It illustrates how high-volume traders can scale beyond the limits of one exchange and maximize a trend move safely. Earlier courses did advise using two exchanges for large trades, but the stepwise scaling at successive signal points is explained more explicitly here.

                     * Trailing Stop Technique & “No Greed” in Practice: While the principle of taking profits was always stressed, here he introduces the explicit rule “lesson number one: green never turns into red” and walks through how to trail a stop from one profit level to the next on the chart. This level of step-by-step illustration – “your stop was here, now it’s here, now it’s here” as the trade progresses – is a nuanced teaching moment that solidifies the concept of protecting profits. The story of the trader who exited after 600k gain and didn’t regret potential further gains reinforces the “no greed” lesson with a real example. These anecdotes and clear rules were not as prominently featured in earlier videos, making them stand out in Course 3.0.

                     * Psychological Warnings and Tone: The tone in this video is a bit more forceful on certain psychological points. For instance, he bluntly says “You’re not a loser. You’re not listening to some shill… All this bullish and bearish crap…makes retailers weak”. In Course 2.0 he mentioned the one-directional mindset issue, but here the language is sharper and more motivational in a tough-love way. He is actively trying to shake the viewer out of herd thinking. This nuanced change in tone (more urgency, a bit of scolding) likely arises because memecoin trading is extremely fast-paced and risky, so he’s emphasizing the need for a professional mindset more than ever.

                     * Live Example and Current Market Relevance: In Course 3.0, he uses current market examples (like Bonk, XRP, GLMI, FALA) and even points out a setup that is forming “as we speak” during the recording. This live aspect is a teaching nuance – it’s not purely hypothetical or historical. He’s effectively mixing a live trading session feel with the course. Earlier courses had examples too, but this one explicitly tries to capture a real-time opportunity (e.g., suggesting a short might trigger on Bonk if it rejects the level again). This makes the lesson very tangible and shows how to apply the framework on the fly.

                     * High-Volume Trader Outreach: Near the end, he mentions that traders doing over $1M volume a week should DM him because the team is working on something special for them. This is a new element, not a trading technique per se, but a nuance in the course’s scope – acknowledging a segment of his audience (whales) and tailoring guidance or tools for them. It reflects how the strategy might have additional layers or services for very heavy traders, a point not brought up in 1.0 or 2.0.

In conclusion, Trading Course 3.0 reinforces the established Ninja Trading framework (discipline, indicator usage, flexibility) but with a sharpened focus on the memecoin boom and how to exploit it. The unique additions – from concrete multi-timeframe tactics to the aggressive scaling methods and the mantra of “green never red” – all serve to equip traders to handle the peculiarly volatile and emotional memecoin environment like a pro. These distinctions will be important when comparing all five course videos, as they show an evolution from basic principles to specialized application in current market conditions.
