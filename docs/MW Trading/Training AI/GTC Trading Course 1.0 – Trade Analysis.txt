Video 1 – Trading Course 1.0 Analysis
Trading Style
The trader’s overall style is a leverage-based, technical trading approach focused on active position management and capital preservation. He emphasizes always “staying in the game” by avoiding scenarios that could force him out (i.e. not getting liquidated). This leads to a defensive yet opportunistic style: he will take positions (often shorting overextended crypto coins like the example Popcat), but size and manage them in such a way that he can withstand large adverse moves and still capitalize when the market eventually turns in his favor. The style is systematic and rule-based, not relying on gut feeling or gambling swings; he even disparages other traders who lack such discipline as doing “mickey mouse trading.
In practice, his trading style involves scaling into and out of positions. Rather than a single entry/exit, he treats trades as a dynamic process: adding to a position if the price goes against him (provided his risk limits allow) and taking partial profits when the price moves in his favor. This requires substantial capital and planning, but it aligns with his goal of controlling emotions – by always having ammunition to adjust a trade, he never feels trapped. He contrasts his careful style with a more aggressive “chase” style used by his team (who “trade on my style, [but] a little bit more riskier). The team’s approach is to short relentlessly and add on every pump without tight timing, which he acknowledges works for them due to experience and deep pockets, but his own style is slightly more cautious and calculated.
Strategy Type
His strategy can be described as a technical, trend-focused strategy with a contrarian bend. Much of the discussion centers on shorting a rapidly rising asset (Popcat) by identifying exhaustion points and betting on mean reversion (i.e. expecting a big dump after a pump). He demonstrates how to short an overbought coin safely, but he also notes that when an asset is in a strong bullish trend (making new all-time highs), one can switch to long strategies to ride the upside momentum. In other words, he is not perma-bear or bull – he reads the chart context (e.g. recognizing “price discovery… super bullish” conditions) and adapts the strategy accordingly.
Overall, the strategy type blends counter-trend trading (shorting peaks of rallies, longing dips of downtrends) with momentum trading (going with the breakout when a confirmation is present). For example, he mentions that after teaching how to short, one might ask why not “long the crap out of [Popcat]” when it broke to new highs – and he agrees that is a valid strategy if done with proper technique. His methods rely heavily on technical analysis signals: he watches for specific triggers like a candle close below an indicator support to initiate shorts, or holding above a moving average to justify longs. The core idea is to capitalize on predictable price movements (bounces, breakouts, breakdowns) while avoiding random bets. He explicitly differentiates trading vs. gambling – entering a huge position on a hunch is “just gambling” in his words, whereas following a systematic plan with confirmations is trading. In summary, his strategy is rules-driven TA trading, primarily aiming for high-probability reversal or continuation moves in the market, backed by an ability to adjust if the move doesn’t immediately play out.
Timeframe Focus
The trader employs a multi-timeframe analysis, using different chart timeframes for different purposes. Key timeframe usage includes:
* Higher Timeframes (4H, 1H, Daily): These frames set the primary trend and strong support/resistance levels. He notes that the 1-hour chart is especially “solid” for making money, as it gives reliable signals with less noise. For instance, he highlights a powerful alignment of the 1H 200MA and his indicator that produced a major uptrend entry. He also refers to daily or higher for context like all-time highs or major trend shifts (e.g. a daily close above a key level being “super bullish). If a trader cannot watch the market constantly, he suggests sticking to these higher timeframes or the daily, which require less frequent decision-making.

* Lower Timeframes (15m, 5m): These are used for fine-tuning entries and exits and for aggressive “chase trading” tactics. He often zooms into the 15-minute or 5-minute to spot invalidation signals or quick retests. For example, on a breakdown setup he says: watch the 15m for a candle close below support, then a brief retest up, and that is the moment to jump in short. However, he warns that on very volatile assets, low timeframe signals can whipsaw (many quick invalidations), so one must be nimble – “take the green when you see it” on those small timeframes. Essentially, he uses 5m/15m for timing and scalp-sized moves, but always in context of the bigger picture.

* Weekly/Macro View: He occasionally zooms out to the weekly chart to assess the broad trend (for example, noting Popcat making a new weekly high and entering price discovery). This long-term perspective informs his bias (bullish vs bearish). While the core trading is done on hourly or lower, this macro lens gives insight into whether a coin is fundamentally strong or overstretched.

By combining these timeframes, the trader can identify a major setup on higher frames and execute it with precision on lower frames. He stresses that the one-hour timeframe plus confirmation from his indicator is often the sweet spot for his style (providing a balance between reliability and agility), with the lower frames used to refine entries or manage ongoing trades.
Risk Management Philosophy
Risk management is the cornerstone of this trader’s methodology. He outlines several critical principles to protect capital and control risk:
   * Avoid Liquidation at All Costs: He repeatedly insists that “the whole game is built on not getting liquidated. In practice, this means using low enough leverage and small enough position size that the liquidation price is extremely far from the current price. He suggests setting one’s liquidation level at “at least a double” the entry price away (for a short position). In his example, entering at $1.30 should have a liquidation around $2.60 or higher. In fact, his preferred “MW style” is to have it 1.5x to 2x further out (e.g. ~$3.20+ in that case) for extra safety, and truly safe positioning might use an even wider 3x distance. The rationale is that the probability of the market moving that far against you in the short-to-mid term is very low (maybe ~1% chance), so you’re unlikely to ever be forced out of the trade. By never getting liquidated, you “always [stay] in the game” to fight another day.

   * Sufficient Capital Buffer: To achieve the above, the trader emphasizes trading with adequate capital. He outright says that trying to leverage trade with just $500 is not sensible – such a small account won’t allow a wide liquidation buffer or adding to positions. He advises funding the account well (e.g. $10k, $20k, $50k depending on one’s ambitions) so that one can open reasonably sized trades and still have plenty of margin left. Having enough funds also means not using all capital in one trade; always reserve some to add if needed. The reason is simple: “if you don’t have enough funds on your account you cannot defend yourself from getting liquidated. This defensive reserve is a recurring theme.

   * No Over-Positioning (Greed Control): The first lesson he gives is “you need to control your greed and emotions, which in practical terms means don’t oversize your position. Greed might tempt a trader to max out leverage or go very heavy because they feel sure of a trade, but he cautions that even if you’re confident, “if the market makers decide to pump it up, you will get wrecked. Proper position sizing ensures that any single trade going wrong won’t wipe you out or trigger emotional panic. He illustrates that if someone is feeling extreme fear during a trade, it’s usually because “he went in too heavy” such that even a normal adverse move puts him at risk. By keeping positions proportional to your account (and thus liquidation far away), you prevent that panic scenario. In short, greed control = size control, which keeps one rational.

   * Scaled Entries to Manage Adversity: A signature risk-management tactic he uses is scaling into losing trades in a controlled way (often called DCA, or dollar-cost averaging, in trading). If the trade goes against the initial entry, he doesn’t immediately stop out; instead, since his liquidation is far away, he can afford to add more in small increments as price moves further (e.g. add a bit at the next resistance level, and more if it goes higher). Each add lowers the average entry price of the short, improving his position such that when the inevitable pullback happens, he can exit around break-even or with a smaller loss. He demonstrates this on the chart: entering, then adding “slowly” as it climbs, so that “when it comes down… you saved yourself” and can even profit on the later drop. This technique requires discipline (you must add small and not get carried away) and a strong conviction that the trend will eventually revert. He notes that “90% of the time” an overextended move will come back down, so his job is to survive until it does. Important: This scaling is only viable because of the prior points (low leverage, plenty of margin). If one’s liquidation was near, adding would be impossible or too risky. By planning for worst-case, he turns a losing trade into a manageable one rather than a disaster.

   * Partial Profit-Taking and De-risking: On the flip side, when a trade starts working, he doesn’t ride full size blindly to the final target – he advocates taking profits incrementally to lock in gains and reduce risk. For example, if a short that was in drawdown comes back to the entry price (i.e. your P&L goes from negative to zero), he says at least take 50% of the position off. By doing so, you bank some profit (or remove the risk if it was break-even) and dramatically cut the exposure. If the price bounces back up after that, you’ve reduced your loss potential and can even consider adding that portion back at a better price. He explains the psychology here: if you never take profit and price reverses, you’ll kick yourself (“Oh my God, why didn’t I take my money back?); if you exit everything too early and it keeps going in your favor, you’ll also feel regret. His solution is a balanced one – take enough profit to secure the win or safety, but keep some position to still participate. He also takes profits at predefined technical points (for instance, he often mentions taking 50% off when price hits the support indicated by his tool, because a bounce is likely). This tiered exit strategy ensures he’s never in a position where a full win turns into a full loss, and it gives mental comfort. In essence, every big move is milked in stages rather than all-or-nothing.

   * Spreading Risk Across Exchanges: As a nuanced risk tactic for high-volume traders, he suggests not putting a very large single trade on one exchange. If one is trading, say, $500k position, he advises splitting it into $250k on one exchange and $250k on another (or even across three exchanges). The idea is to avoid slippage or being targeted by an exchange’s market makers – with multiple venues, it’s harder for any one to manipulate against your full size. This is a less common tip and applies to those trading huge size (he notes it’s mainly for accounts $100k+). It shows his deep consideration of risk: not just market risk but execution and counterparty risk as well (using only one venue could be a single point of failure).

All these points illustrate a risk-first mentality. He structures his entire trading method to minimize chances of catastrophic loss. By controlling greed, using sufficient capital, keeping leverage low, and actively managing positions, he significantly lowers the probability of a blow-up. The benefit, as he notes, is not just financial survival but also psychological — when you know you’re safe, you trade without fear, which leads to better decision-making. This tight risk management is the “pill” he offers to kill the emotions that plague traders, allowing one to execute a plan calmly.
Psychological Profile
From the transcript, the trader comes across as highly disciplined, battle-tested, and brutally honest about trading realities. Psychologically, he prioritizes emotional control above all else. He constantly highlights greed and fear as the enemies of success, indicating a deep understanding that a trader’s mindset can sabotage any strategy if not managed. In his own words, controlling emotion is “lesson number one for trading. This suggests he has likely learned from experience how devastating uncontrolled emotions (like chasing profits or panicking in drawdowns) can be. By advocating concrete risk management rules to pre-empt emotional reactions (e.g. wide liquidation levels to prevent fear, automatic profit-taking to curb greed), he shows a very pragmatic psychology: rather than simply telling himself “be disciplined,” he sets up his trading environment to enforce discipline.
He also demonstrates a confidence and conviction in his methods. For example, he mentions having “nailed” multiple market dumps on that coin and speaks with authority about how professional traders operate versus amateurs. There’s a touch of skepticism (or even cynicism) in his perspective: he believes many trading groups/gurus out there are effectively in league with exchanges to cause liquidations of retail traders. Whether true or not, this outlook has shaped him into a very defensive trader who assumes the market is out to get you. Psychologically, that makes him cautious and always prepared. It also perhaps fuels a bit of a combative attitude – he refers to some others as having “no clue what they’re doing and calls the crypto market a “dirty business” where brokers profit from client losses. This no-nonsense, somewhat aggressive stance likely helps his students trust his insights (he positions himself as someone who has seen behind the curtain and is looking out for the little guy).
Despite a tough exterior, his mindset is highly strategic rather than emotional. He encourages traders to remain calm and patient: for instance, if a trade is going against you but your plan is sound, you should stay relaxed and maybe even hope for a further move against you so you can add at a better price. This is a counter-intuitive emotional stance – embracing temporary pain for long-term gain – which only works if one has mastered fear. He illustrates that the typical trader’s emotional script (“Whenever I enter, the market goes the other way”) is just psychological bias and that his method can break that cycle by removing the emotional triggers. In essence, he’s trained himself (and wants to train others) to think in terms of strategy and probabilities, not money won or lost in the moment.
His language also gives clues to his psychology: he often repeats key phrases like a mantra (“control your greed and emotion” is repeated many times) – this repetition shows how fundamental he considers it, almost a meditation. He uses vivid terms for emotional states, like “on tilt” (a poker term for emotional chaos), indicating he’s very aware of the psychological pitfalls in trading and has names for them. At the same time, he exhibits self-assurance bordering on bravado – e.g. pointing out he alone called certain market moves, or confidently stating “this is trading guys… this is how you trade. This suggests a strong belief in his expertise (likely hard-earned), and that confidence can be infectious to students. It’s clear he values mental toughness: he admires how his team can short a coin without flinching through rallies (“they just don’t care” about interim moves) – that fearlessness is something he cultivates by having solid risk buffers.
In summary, the trader’s psychological profile is characterized by discipline, skepticism of easy fixes, a proactive handling of emotions, and a confident, sometimes aggressive, attitude. He approaches markets with the mentality of a survivor and a tactician, always planning for the worst to ensure he stays composed. His teaching attempts to impart this same mental resilience to his audience.
Tools Used
Throughout the session, the trader references and utilizes several tools and techniques that define his trading system:
      * Proprietary Indicator (“the indicator”): A key tool repeatedly mentioned is “the indicator” that he and his team use for signals. While he doesn’t name it explicitly, it’s treated as an essential gadget for identifying likely support/resistance and bounce points. For example, when price dips to the indicator level, he expects about a 60-70% chance of a bounce, which informs his decision to take profit or reduce position at that point. The indicator is used on multiple timeframes (he switches it on 15min, 1H, etc.) and works in tandem with price action; e.g. “if we’re holding the indicator… if we lose it with a confirmed candle close, that’s a short opportunity. We can infer this tool might be a custom momentum or trend-following indicator that the Gain Trading group relies on heavily for entries/exits.

      * 200 MA (200-Day/Period Moving Average): He frequently mentions the 200MA as a crucial technical reference, especially when combined with the indicator. On the 1H chart of Popcat, he notes that “when the 200MA comes together with the indicator…it’s one of the most powerful moments for price. This convergence provided a prime long entry in his example. He also uses the 200MA as a support level on lower timeframes and part of confirmation signals (e.g. shorting when price breaks below both the indicator and perhaps the 200MA). The 200MA is a common tool among technical traders for identifying the broader trend, and here it serves as both a trend filter and a trigger level.

      * Charting & Technical Analysis Tools: Beyond specific indicators, he uses standard charting techniques: identifying resistance lines, entry zones, and support levels (he drew a resistance at $1.30 as an entry zone for the short); observing price patterns like breakouts and retests; and using concepts of confirmation vs. invalidation (waiting for candle closes beyond levels to validate a move, rather than reacting to wicks). He also mentions price discovery (when an asset makes new highs) and how that’s a bullish sign. All these indicate he’s well-versed in classic technical analysis. The combination of these tools with his custom indicator forms his trading “system”.

      * Multiple Exchanges & Platforms: For trade execution, he highlights the use of multiple crypto exchange accounts. He names “Blovin”, “Bidunax”, “Weeks”, and “Divider” – likely pseudonyms or code-names for actual exchanges – as platforms with good trading apps. The reason for using more than one exchange is partly risk management (as discussed) and partly to take advantage of each platform’s features/liquidity. He specifically advises splitting large orders across at least two exchanges. This suggests he utilizes advanced exchange tools (like perhaps API trading or at least manual on multiple screens) and is savvy about how exchanges operate. He also notes improvements in those trading apps, implying he keeps up with platform updates and might use features like stop-loss, take-profit, or advanced order types available on them.

      * Communication & Signal Tools: Within his group, they use certain notations to communicate trade management. For instance, he says the team marks a “check mark” in their group updates when they take profits or decrease a position. This is more of a community tool, but it shows an organized way of signaling actions. He also references posting charts and tweets – e.g., “when I share a post… that’s the big move coming – indicating he uses social media (Twitter) and group chats to disseminate analysis. The implication is that chart annotation tools, screenshot sharing, and perhaps streaming (he mentions previous live streams) are part of his toolkit for both analysis and teaching.

      * Order Execution Tools: While not a specific software, he makes it clear how he executes orders: often using market orders to exit quickly when needed (“just get out, market sell out” on invalidation), and presumably limit orders to add positions at desired levels. He also practices DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) into positions as a tool/technique, manually adding in increments. This is effectively using the exchange’s order system to pyramid into trades. The way he describes adding “slowly” suggests he may use limit orders at strategic intervals or simply watch and add at market when a level hits, depending on context.

In essence, the trader’s toolkit is a blend of a custom indicator + classic TA + savvy trade execution on multiple exchanges. He leverages technology (indicators, chart platforms, mobile trading apps) and technique (TA patterns, moving averages) together. It’s notable that he does not mention any fundamental analysis tools or news – his approach appears 100% technical. Everything from trend identification to timing is done on the chart with these tools. This reinforces that his style is that of a technical ninja – using chart indicators and execution tricks to outmaneuver the market makers.
Execution Preference
The execution model favored by this trader is hands-on and adaptive, prioritizing confirmation and flexibility over preset and rigid orders. Several aspects define his execution preferences:
         * Confirmation-Based Entries: He often waits for specific confirmation signals before fully committing to a trade. For example, rather than shorting the instant a support looks weak, he waits for a candle to “close below it” to confirm breakdown, and often even for a slight retest upward to enter at a better price. This approach avoids false breakouts. He gives an example of an entry trigger: “closed candle… below [the indicator], that’s your short entry, then add on the small bounce. By trading on invalidation signals (i.e. evidence that an uptrend is failing or a downtrend is reversing), he increases the probability that his entry is near the pivot point of a move. This indicates a preference for technically justified entries rather than impulsive ones. That said, in fast markets he acknowledges one might jump in “directly” and then be ready to add more if it goes the other way – but even that is a planned tactic (enter small, plan to add).

         * Scaling into Positions: As noted earlier, his style is to build a position gradually. Execution-wise, this means his initial entry might be a fraction of his intended size, allowing room to add. He explicitly states “you have to do it slowly” when adding to a losing trade – implying he might divide his capital into multiple bullets (e.g. enter 25% now, add 25% later, etc.). This not only improves his average price but also psychologically eases the pressure (since each add is pre-planned, not a panicked reaction). Scaling is also used on winning trades: he doesn’t mention it as much as adding to losers, but he does describe adding back to a short after taking profit, if the price bounces up again into resistance. Essentially, he legged out and then back into the trade. This pyramiding method is a sophisticated execution preference, aiming to maximize gains on swings while minimizing risk at each stage.

         * Active Trade Management & Partial Exits: He manages trades actively once in. A key preference is to take partial profits at interim targets. He might close 50% of a position at a first support, as soon as the trade has some profit, rather than aiming for a home run with full size. He’ll even take profit very quickly on lower timeframe trades – e.g., “You made 500 bucks, whatever. Just take the damn money… you’re out. Wait… Short opened, break even, out., meaning he has no issue closing a trade entirely once it’s made a decent gain, then reopening if conditions still favor it. This shows a scalper’s mindset combined with a swing trader’s plan: harvest gains frequently and re-engage if the larger thesis is still valid. By preferring to bank profits, he reduces exposure and can handle the next execution (be it adding again or switching bias) from a position of strength.

         * Tight Invalidation and Cutting Losses: Although he doesn’t use traditional stop-loss orders (preferring manual control due to his wide stops), he is very clear about cutting a trade if it proves wrong. “If it closes above [the level you shorted], get out. Just get out, market sell out. is his instruction. This indicates that once an invalidation level is hit (i.e. the reason for entry is negated), his preference is an immediate exit at market to avoid further loss. He’s not stubborn with a losing thesis; his stubbornness is only about not getting liquidated. If the market invalidates the setup (for instance, what should have been a breakdown turns into a recovery), he will take the loss quickly. This is a hallmark of good execution – he keeps losses small and predetermined by planning where he’ll bail out. It just so happens that his predetermined loss point is far (because of low leverage), but it’s still a defined condition (e.g., “if price reclaims the level I shorted, I’m out”).

         * “Chase Trading” Variation: In contrast to the cautious confirmation approach, he describes the team’s chase trading style as an alternative execution mode. In chase trading, they enter trades without waiting for full confirmation – essentially shorting as soon as a level is reached or even in anticipation – and then aggressively adding as price moves further against them (since they know they have a huge margin buffer). Their execution is fearless: “They don’t trade it on a 15m… They don’t give a crap. They’re just chasing it down.. While this is not exactly his personal preferred mode for teaching beginners, it’s worth noting as part of the model he presents. It’s an ultra-assertive execution that relies on heavy capital and conviction, and he plans to cover it in a dedicated video. The takeaway is that execution can be context-dependent: if one has the skill and capital, they might execute earlier and scale more (high risk, high reward); if one is playing safer, they execute on confirmation and with stricter exits.

         * Frequent Monitoring: His execution style does seem to assume the trader is actively watching the market or at least checking regularly. He describes sequences like waiting for a retest, adding here, taking off there, re-adding later – which implies being engaged with the chart nearly in real-time. He even says if one doesn’t have time to “eye” the market constantly, they should switch to higher timeframes or avoid chase trading. So, his preference leans towards active intraday execution (especially on 15m signals). This is supported by his advice to use 5m/15m charts to catch the moment of invalidation or confirmation. It suggests he likely sets alerts or watches price live to execute at the right moments, rather than using only automated orders.

In summary, the trader’s execution preferences are highly proactive and flexible: wait for the right moment (confirmation) to strike, enter gradually (don’t deploy full size at once), manage the position (take profits, add more if needed), and cut out quickly if the market proves the trade wrong. He essentially treats trading like a tactical campaign – making a series of moves (entries/exits) in response to the market’s moves, all pre-planned within a framework. This nimble execution style requires skill and attention but is key to how he achieves such a high success rate (he notes the team, using similar execution, loses only a tiny fraction of their trades).
Unique Insights and Teaching Nuances
Video 1 is rich with the trader’s unique insights and personal teaching style, which set the tone for his “Ninja” methodology. Some notable insights and nuances include:
            * “Never Get Liquidated” – A Paradigm Shift: Perhaps the most striking principle he instills is that avoiding liquidation is more important than any single trade win. He frames trading as a survival game where brokers and market makers are actively trying to liquidate retail traders. This almost conspiratorial insight (that “they have agreements... they want you liquidated) serves to justify his ultra-conservative risk approach. It’s a unique angle, making students acutely aware that capital preservation is the top priority and that one must trade in a way that frustrates the market’s attempts to take you out. This insight goes beyond typical risk management by personifying the market as an adversary – a nuance that can strongly motivate traders to follow his rules (it’s not just math, it’s “us vs them”).

            * Colorful Language and Analogies: His teaching style is far from dry – he uses vivid language, analogies, and even sound-effect words to get points across. For instance, he refers to sub-par trading educators as “Mickey Mouse charting, Mickey Mouse trading to convey their incompetence. When describing the moment a heavily shorted market finally collapses, he exclaims “kaboom, ching ching to mimic the sound of cashing in profits. He uses “boom, boom, boom” repeatedly when walking through price action sequences, and “pop pop pop… invalidation” to illustrate a rapid series of signals. These linguistic quirks not only keep the audience engaged, but also create memorable cues associated with trading concepts (you can almost hear those “boom, boom” moments when a pattern completes). He even brings in a poker term “on tilt” to describe an emotional trader’s state, showing his ability to draw parallels from other domains to make a point. All of this makes his teaching lively and relatable, imprinting lessons with a bit of humor and drama.

            * Step-by-Step Didactic Structure: The instructor is methodical in teaching the basics. He literally labels “lesson number one” and “number two” during the talk. Lesson 1 was controlling greed/emotions; Lesson 2 was having enough funds (margin). By structuring it this way, he ensures the viewers know these are foundational concepts. He reinforces them by repetition throughout the video (circling back to those points again at the end: “first of all… control your greed… number one. Together with it, enough funds on your account). This structured approach is a teaching nuance that helps learners remember the core principles. He also frequently says “why is this so important? and then answers it, which is a classic teaching technique to emphasize significance. The use of hypothetical examples (“suppose you entered here… suppose it goes up…”) is another nuance – he walks the viewer through imagined scenarios to show how to apply the rules in real situations, making the learning practical.

            * Emphasis on Psychology as a Skill: Unlike many trading tutorials that jump into technical setups, this trader spends a considerable portion of the session on psychology and mindset (greed, fear, emotional control). His unique twist is tying psychology to concrete actions: e.g., “I cannot teach you to not be emotional, but I can give you the pill… This is the pill, with the “pill” being his risk management method. By doing so, he demystifies emotional control – treating it as a byproduct of proper strategy rather than some innate trait. This is a nuanced insight: the best way to manage your emotions is to manage your risk. It shifts the focus from trying to be mentally tough to simply being smart in trade preparation, which is an actionable lesson for students.

            * Challenging Conventional Wisdom: He isn’t afraid to say that common practices taught elsewhere are wrong. For instance, he implies that typical stop-loss strategies taught by “crypto schools” lead to gambling-like behavior and liquidation, whereas his approach of adding to losing trades (usually considered risky) is actually safer when done right. This contrarian stance – advocating controlled averaging down, for example – is a unique teaching point that sets him apart. He’s effectively saying “everything you’ve been told about cut your losses quickly might not apply in leverage crypto if you play my style.” Whether one agrees or not, it’s a nuanced perspective that he backs with reasoning (market makers hunt stops, so don’t place your stop where they can hit it – instead, use low leverage and no hard stop).

            * Focus on Real Trade Examples and Data: He often references real trades or outcomes to lend credibility and insight. He mentions specific instances like “four retailers made their first million shorting Popcat, or that his team has a win rate where out of 1000 chase trades, only ~2-3 were losses. These tidbits provide evidence that his methods can work and also teach by example (the fact that others made millions using high volume is inspiration, and the extremely high win-rate of the team underscores the power of their risk management). It’s also insightful how he transparently shares that the high-volume guys “risked a lot of money” to get that million – a nuance acknowledging that reward came with significant risk, aligning with his no free lunch philosophy.

            * Nuanced View of Market Dynamics: He frequently articulates nuanced points about how markets move. For example, he notes that after a breakdown and close below support, “most of the time they like to retest” up a bit before the real drop – this is a subtle insight into price behavior (fake-outs and retests) that many novices might not know. He also distinguishes between a quick wick vs. a candle close for confirming a move, teaching students not to get fooled by temporary spikes. Additionally, his explanation of volatility on lower timeframes (15m giving many false signals in a volatile coin) and advising to take quick profits there is a nuanced tactical tip. These details indicate a deep practical understanding of market mechanics and trader behavior, which he passes on in his commentary.

            * Community and Style Consistency: There’s a nuance in how he aligns his teaching with a broader community (“Reto fam”, “the team”, “Gain Trading group”). He mentions he agreed to share the video with another group that trades his style, highlighting a sense of shared methodology. Also, terms like “MWM” or “MW” style come up, suggesting he has a signature style that his followers recognize. By teaching in this video, he’s ensuring everyone in the community uses terms the same way and understands the strategy deeply. His use of jargon (“free private” group, etc.) without much explanation implies the audience is somewhat familiar with his ecosystem. This nuance shows he’s teaching not just in general, but tailoring to a specific cohort of traders who follow him – ensuring consistency for a brand of trading style across a group. For a custom GPT model, picking up this consistent terminology and approach is crucial.

In conclusion, Video 1 provides a foundation of the trader’s style and philosophy, delivered with a distinctive flair. The unique mix of hardline risk rules, psychological coaching, contrarian tactics, and colorful storytelling creates a rich profile of this trader. These insights and nuances will be instrumental in training a custom GPT model to emulate his approach, as they capture not just what he does, but how he thinks and talks about trading. The emphasis on fundamentals (both technical basics and psychological basics) in this first video sets the stage for more advanced topics in subsequent videos, ensuring that anyone learning his “ninja” style is building on a solid base. Each of the elements above contributes to an understanding of the method that is as much about mindset as it is about mechanics – a key theme of his teachings.
